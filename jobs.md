Secondary 'gold' flagged in feedback
- check if site uses the proper secondary
- ask for feedback on different

breakpoints for hero need fixing for mobile
- content hangs over edges, needs to be smaller, and 100vh height maximum too


news page / newsletter
- same page?
- newsletter specifically flagged by multiple people as a priority
- - include a new newsletter section on homepage? and remove the current 'news' one?
- - include both?
- - revise banner for newsletter / live mass? (live mass was the other section highlighted by multiple people as a top priority)
- - could include 'News' in the navigation bar, with a drop down for 'news (clicking wouth navigate to the news page, which includes general news **AND** the newsletter), newsletter (clicking would navigate to current week newsletter).
- does church require a seperate news section? or is newsletter sufficient?
- pro: reduce friction / confusion, keep all relevant content in same place
- con: extra info together, user has to 'learn' that both content on same page
- logic to counter cons:
- - include 'category' filtering to filter for all newsletters in 1 click
- - include sign up form with 2 buttons: newsletter sign up only, or newsletter and 'news' sign up

Main options (Navigation bar)
- 'News' in the navigation bar, general news page with sub links to specifics (ie newsletter)
-- Pros: Generalised section for all news, no ambiguity regarding what is available
-- Cons: An additional click / page to navigate to find the newsletter, slightly more friction to find the newsletter.
- 'Newsletter' in the navigation bar, links directly to newsletter
-- Pros: Minimal friction for Newsletter specifically
-- Cons: Ambiguity regarding total news/content is available

Main options (Homepage)
- General 'News/Newsletter' section on the homepage
-- For example, it could be the same as what we currently have, but include a button for the 'Newsletter' specifically
- A specific one (News __or__ Newsletter)
- Neither

My opinion:
