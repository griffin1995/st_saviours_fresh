GLOBAL PATTERNS & RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. CRITICAL: ESCAPED QUOTES IN DESCRIPTIONS
   Pattern: 4 articles contain escaped quotes (\') in description field
   Affected Articles: Article 4 (Saint Rafqa), Article 11 (April), Article 14 (January), Article 17 (May)
   Issue: Appears to be import/JSON encoding issue
   Recommendation: Remove escape characters - these shouldn't be escaped in JavaScript string literals

2. CRITICAL: TRAILING NEWLINES IN TITLE/DESCRIPTION/CAPTION
   Pattern: 14 articles have trailing newline characters (\n) in title, description, or imageCaption fields
   Affected Articles: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
   Impact: Potential rendering issues and whitespace problems
   Recommendation: Remove all trailing \n from these string fields during import

3. CRITICAL: DUPLICATE ARTICLE CONTENT
   Pattern: Articles 5 and 6 are nearly identical duplicates (Julian of Norwich)
   Affected Articles: theology-and-theologians-julian-of-norwich-theologian vs theology-and-theologians-julian-of-norwich
   Issue: Different IDs/slugs but identical content creates confusion
   Recommendation: Consolidate to single article OR differentiate content clearly

4. UNIVERSAL: MISSING METADATA FIELDS
   Pattern: ALL 18 articles missing one or more standard metadata fields
   - Author: Missing from ALL articles (18/18)
   - Tags: Missing from ALL articles (18/18)
   - ReadingTime: Missing from ALL articles (18/18)
   - Featured: Missing or not set from MOST articles (15/18)
   Recommendation: Populate these fields across all articles for consistency

5. SUPERSCRIPT NOTATION INCONSISTENCY
   Pattern: 12 articles use markdown superscript (^th^, ^rd^, ^st^) instead of proper HTML <sup>
   Affected Articles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18
   Locations: In titles, descriptions, imageCaptions, and content
   Recommendation: Replace all instances of X^th^ with X<sup>th</sup> globally

6. MISSING DESCRIPTIONS FOR LEARNING CONTENT
   Pattern: Article 3 (14th Century Timeline) lacks description field
   Impact: Homepage and category listings lack preview text
   Recommendation: Add substantive descriptions to all articles

7. INCOMPLETE/TRUNCATED CONTENT
   Pattern: 2 articles appear to end abruptly
   - Article 2 (13th Century Timeline): Ends with "AI Overview"
   - Article 8 (Litanies): Ends with "Popular litanies" heading with no content
   Recommendation: Review these articles for completeness; likely import errors

8. MARKDOWN FORMATTING IN HTML CONTEXT
   Pattern: Some fields use markdown formatting instead of HTML
   - Article 5, 6: Intro field contains *text* instead of <em>text</em>
   - Article 1, 2: Mixed markdown and HTML formatting
   Recommendation: Standardize on HTML formatting throughout

9. IMAGE CAPTION INCONSISTENCY
   Pattern: ImageCaption field usage is inconsistent
   - Some articles have imageCaptions (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18)
   - Some articles missing imageCaption despite having images (3, 6, 10)
   - Captions sometimes placed in content instead of dedicated field
   Recommendation: Standardize imageCaption usage across all articles with images

10. TABLE OF CONTENTS MISSING FROM LONG ARTICLES
    Pattern: Articles 15+ minutes reading time lack tableOfContents
    Affected Articles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18
    Recommendation: Add tableOfContents to articles with 5+ major sections

11. REFERENCES FIELD INCONSISTENCY
    Pattern: Only 1 article (7) properly uses references field
    - Most articles have sources/references in content as text links
    - No formal structured references field used
    Recommendation: Extract source links and populate references field for all academic articles

12. CATEGORY NAMING CONSISTENCY
    Pattern: Church History timeline articles inconsistently titled
    - Articles 1, 2: "The Catholic Church In The Xth Century: a timeline of key events"
    - Article 3: "Xth Century Timeline"
    Recommendation: Standardize titles across timeline series for better UX

13. INTRO VS DESCRIPTION INCONSISTENCY
    Pattern: Some articles use intro field, others use description field
    - Learning Hub articles: Use description
    - Some articles: Also have intro field
    Recommendation: Clarify which field should be primary across all articles

14. MALFORMED HTML CODE BLOCKS
    Pattern: Article 7 contains invalid HTML class names
    Location: Lines 417-418, 426-427
    Issue: `<pre><code class="language-{=html}">&lt;!-- --&gt;</code></pre>`
    Impact: Syntax highlighting fails; renders as plain code
    Recommendation: Remove or fix these malformed blocks

15. DATE FORMAT CONSISTENCY
    Pattern: All articles use YYYY-MM-DD format - CONSISTENT
    Recommendation: Continue this standard
