intro: "Peter Abelard (1079--21 April 1142) came to prominence as a philosopher, poet, musician, and theologian. But it came at great cost. Abelard's systematic and audacious treatment of religious doctrines are noted for their understanding, subtlety, and intellectual brilliance. His affair with Héloïse made him a tragic figure of romance and, across time, it is this and not his contribution to theology, the main reason for his fame."

**\[TITLE\] Peter Abelard: Tragic genius**

Much of Abelard's life is chronicled in his writing and for all his brilliance, his tendency towards self-indulgence and feelings that the world did not understand his genius, contributed to much of his suffering. He championed the use of reason in matters of faith and was among the first to use 'theology' in its modern sense, alongside his contemporary Peter Lombard. The world doesn't always like or appreciate genius. Many people of outstanding intellect suffer immensely. The fates of Alan Turing and Hypatia of Alexandria, despite their accomplishments, show that not much has changed over the centuries in this regard.

The quality of Abelard, is that while opposition to much of his writings resulted in harassment and humiliation by leading figures in the Catholic Church, is that his intellectual heft helped him rise above much of it. And it is to his credit that he stood on his principles, sometimes at great cost.

We know quite a bit about Peter Abelard, because much of his world view and his responses to the challenges that faced him are outlined in his long autobiographical letter *Historia calamitatum*. It literally translates as 'The story of my troubles'. His poignant correspondence with the equally tragic Héloïse, the love of his life and mother of his son, tell us much about his character.

## Abelard's early life. {#abelards-early-life}

Abelard was born some time between 1078 and 1080 in the small town of Le Pallet, near Nantes, in Brittany, where his noble family carried weight. As a consequence of his family's wealth, he was well educated, particularly in the Classics and he was clearly a bright student. His early introduction to Greek and Roman writers and historians was later reflected in the familiarity with which he harnessed some of their ideas and philosophy into his own.

Equally, like other notable people of the Medieval period (I'm thinking of St Francis of Assisi, St Catherine of Siena, and others) Abelard cast off his prosperous backstory to serve God and his massive intellect through teaching and the formulation of new critical approaches to the study of theology. Like many of his contemporary Medieval luminaries, Abelard renounced his inheritance to study philosophy under tutors such as Roscelin and William of Champeaux.

## Abelard's early influencers {#abelards-early-influencers}

Roscelin of Compiegne (1050- 1125), was an early tutor of Abelard, teaching both philosopher and theology. Roscelin had studied at both Soissons and Rheinis. In 1098 he became a canon at Compiegne and taught there and at Besancon. Styled by his contemporaries as *Novi Lyaei Conditor* (essential founder of new schools or teaching), he is regarded by historians as an early originator of the critical school of nominalism, in the study of universals. In the medieval world, universals referred to abstract concepts or general terms that apply to multiple individual things. They were a central topic of debate, exploring whether these universals had an independent reality or were simply mental constructs. 

Universals denoted, argued medieval scholars, either real, existing things beyond individual instances and experience, or they were simply labels used to categorise and understand the world, depending on which side you were on. The debate grappled with, for instance, whether properties such as \"roundness\" exist independently of the things that are round, and if so, how?

An often quoted simile that helps describe this tension is our encounter with, for example, multiple instances of \"redness,\". Do we understand the concept of redness outside of things we understand as red, such as a red pillar box? Do our minds form a concept of \"redness\" solely based on our experiences of seeing items that are red (a pillarbox, or lipstick). Or do we understand the colour red outside our immediate experience of it? And if we understand it outside of our experience, what do we base our understanding on?

In Abelard's day there was little consensus on the understanding of universals. In fact, it vexed philosophers for centuries. Why was it important? Because the study of universals involves important questions about the nature of perception, existence, location, and the means of understanding these properties.

It certainly vexed Aristotle and Plato, who took different approaches to the question and their arguments were regularly resurrected in medieval halls of academia. Plato took the view that universals exist as eternal, unchanging forms, separate from the physical world and that particular objects participate in or resemble these forms. For example, there\'s a perfect, ideal form of \"redness\" that all red things in the world merely imitate. Aristotle, on the other hand argued that universals exist in the particulars, and not separately. Redness, for instance, exists within each individual red object. There isn\'t a separate form of redness that they all share. 

If all this seems pedantic, remember that modern philosophy was still in its embryonic form. Moreover, it was a time in history when leading thinkers such as St Thomas Aquinas would drill down ideas to infinitesimal proportions. Aquinas proposed, for instance, calculations for determining the number of angels that could dance on a pinhead!

We have no extant treatise of Compiegne to determine exactly what his position was, other than a letter to Peter Abelard, who studied under him at Besancon. Roscelin's nominalism stuck with Abelard, who later refined his own approach to universals, which came to be called Conceptualism. More of that later. We understand from that letter that Roscelin understood universals to be no more than verbal expressions. Roscelin died about 1100.

William of Champeaux (1070-1122) meanwhile taught at the Cathedral School of Notre Dame in Paris and was a proponent of the scholastic approach to universals. This involved reaching a conclusion by juxtaposing two opposing views. Abelard would both compete with and regularly return to hear Williams teaching on universals and adopted William's dialectic approach in many of his works, in particular *Sic et Non*.

## Abelard and Conceptualism {#abelard-and-conceptualism}

What Abelard did was lay out the problem of understanding universals as abstract concepts with no corresponding reality. It was initially a nominalist approach and one that carried weight well into the 12^th^ century. The philosopher William of Ockham (of Occam's' Razor) developed nominalism substantially. However, Abelard looked for a way to merge opposing opinions. He began to think that universals exist only as concepts in our minds (Conceptualism), which was a middle way. Clearly building on the nominalist position of William of Champeaux, Abelard's point was that universals are not simply names (like nominalism) nor independent entities (like realism). He argued that universal concepts are formed through abstraction from individual, experienced things. 

Abelard\'s conceptualism significantly shaped the medieval philosophical debate on universals and continues to be relevant in discussions today about the nature of concepts and knowledge. 

By 1104 Abelard felt confident enough to set himself up as a lecturer, first at Melun and then at Corbeil. In the early 12^th^ century, centres of learning competed with each other to attract students by dint of the reputation of their leading tutors. Abelard competed mainly with his previous tutor William of Champeaux for students and reputation.

The strain of intellectual competition however proved too much---Abelard's health failed, and he returned to Brittany for several years. Abelard returned to Paris sometime between 1108 and 1113 with his health restored. He even attended William of Champeaux's lectures, and argued with him William over the problem of universals. According to Abelard's rather self-satisfied report, he bested his teacher in debate, and gained his reputation as a dialectician of note, teaching at several schools.

Around 1113 Abelard decided to study theology; he sought out the most eminent teacher of theology of his day, Anselm of Laon, and became his student. In the event, Anselm's traditional methods were antithetical to Abelard, who eventually returned to Notre Dame to continue on his own. It would be the last time he studied with anyone.

At Notre Dame he became entangled with Héloïse, which led to his castration \[*we are not going to cover this here, there are references at the end if you want to follow up this part of Abelard's life*\]. He then entered the Benedictine monastery of Saint Denis to recover, after which he began teaching at a local priory and it is there that he developed his theology of the Trinity.

From this point on, Abelard's audacious approach to theology and philosophy caused him to drift inexorably into regular conflict with the church and its leaders. His method of philosophical analysis was seen as a direct challenge to more traditional approaches. The reaction to his work became so strong that a special synod was convened in Soissons in 1121, to examine Abelard's writing.

The bishops particularly objected to his book *Theologia,* which they condemned as heretical and it was publicly burned. The bishops argued that dialectical reasoning (in other words, logic) in discussing the Trinity was inappropriate and potentially led to heretical interpretations. They required intellectually arrogant Abelard to make a public avowal of faith, which invariably was meant to humble him. He was also forced into effective exile in an area of difficult terrain to devote himself to quiet contemplation.

His period of exile didn't last long as Abelard himself said that poverty forced him to resume teaching. Together with a coterie of students, who were attracted to his then innovative approach to study, he constructed an oratory that they called the Paraclete, where he continued to write, teach, and research.

In 1126, Abelard accepted an invitation to become abbot of the monastery of Saint Gildas de Rhuys in Brittany. He donated the Paraclete to the convent of Argenteuil, where Héloïse had retired to after the birth of their son Astrolabe. However, Abelard found the monks of Saint Gildas difficult and obstructive. It is here that he wrote one of his masterworks, *Historia calamitatum,* where he claimed there were a number of attempts on his life.

By the mid-1130s Abelard was given permission to return to Paris to teach, albeit retaining his title as abbot. Now his work came to attention of Bernard of Clairvaux, who objected to some of Abelard's conclusions as well as to his approach to matters of faith. Their tussle over approaches to faith lasted years, despite some attempts to resolve their differences of opinion. Finally, in 1140 Abelard asked the Archbishop of Sens to arrange a public debate between Bernard and himself. Bernard eventually agreed, but in the interim arranged to convene another commission of enquiry to review Abelard's treatises.

Abelard was horrified to find there was somewhat of a fixed jury, rather than an objective debating forum. He withdrew, announcing he would travel to Rome to appeal to the Pope over his mistreatment. Meanwhile, the commission condemned nineteen propositions it claimed to find in his works and adjourned. Bernard also scuppered Abelard's appeal to the Pope and a letter from Pope Innocent II upheld the decision of the Council of Soisson while Abelard was a Cluny. The letter ordered him to silence and reconciliation with Bernard, to which Abelard complied.

Peter the Venerable, the abbot of Cluny, wrote to the Pope about the reconciliation between Abelard and Bernard, and the Pope lifted Abelard's sentence. Abelard remained under the protection of Peter the Venerable first at Cluny, then at St. Marcel, but after so much tumult in his life, Abelard's his health began to deteriorate. Abelard died on 21 April 1142. His body was interred at the Paraclete, and today is (with Héloïse) buried in Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

## Abelard's Works {#abelards-works}

Abelard was a prolific writer for his time and wrote across a number of categories, including logic, dialectics, theology, the philosophy of language, and metaphysics. His two masterworks are:

-   *Logica* '*ingredientibus*',

-   *Dialectica*,

His lesser works on logic include:

-   *Introductiones parvulorum*,

-   *Logica* '*nostrorum petitioni sociorum*',

-   *Tractatus de intellectibus*,

-   *Sententiae secundum Magistrum Petrum*,

Abelard's works on ethics include:

-   *Ethica seu Scito teipsum*,

-   *Dialogus inter Philosophum, Iudaeum, et Christianum*, "The Dialogue of a Philosopher with a Jew and a Christian".

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   *Carmen ad Astralabium*, "Poem for Astralabe."

Abelard's works of philosophical theology include:

-   *Theologia* '*summi boni*'.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   *Theologia christiana*,

-   *Theologia* '*scholarium*',

It is these works that created many problems for Abelard and they had to be revised. The first version of the *Theology summi boni*  was the treatise objected to by the Council of Soisssons, which resulted in his temporary exile. While *Theologia* '*scholarium*' was condemned at the Council of Sens, was the bone of contention between Abelard and St Bernard of Clairvaux. Abelard also wrote several commentaries:

-   *Expositio orationis dominicae*, "Analysis of the Lord's Prayer."

-   *Expositio symboli Apostolorum*, "Analysis of the Apostle's Creed."

-   *Expositio fidei in symbolum Athanasii*, "Analysis of Faith in the Athanasian Creed."

-   *Hexaëmeron*, "Commentary on *Genesis* 1--2:25."

-   *Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos*, "Commentary on St. Paul's Letter to the Romans."

Abelard questioned notions of faith and reason in a short work:

-   *Soliloquium*, "Soliloquy."

Finally, Abelard composed the highly influential *Sic et non*, (For and Against), citing published arguments for and against a series of questions, 158 in all.
