  The Catholic Church In The 12^th^ Century: a timeline of key events
description: |
  The end of the 11th century and the start of the 12^th^ century was a watershed for the Catholic Church. Major changes in the European and Near Eastern political landscape had far-reaching implications for Catholics of the period. Below is a timeline highlighting some of the highlights of the period, which affected the Catholic Church and the principal theologians and popes of the day. They are and will be covered in more detail in subsequent articles and discussions.

Spiritually, key figures such as the Italian monk and statesman Lanfranc, and the English Benedictine monk Anselm of Canterbury, led church reforms in England, including the reorganisation of dioceses and establishing firmer monastic rules. Anselm also wrote influential works, such as *Why Did God Become a Man*? exploring the reasons for Christ\'s death. Polyphonic singing emerged, replacing Gregorian Chant, and the harp arrived in Europe. 

The 12th century saw a series of significant popes who navigated complex political landscapes and religious reforms. Some notable figures include Paschal II, Calixtus II, Innocent II, and Alexander III.  Other notable popes of the 12th century include Honorius II, Celestine II, Lucius II, Eugene III, Anastasius IV, and Lucius III, each contributing to the complex history of the papacy during this period. This era also witnessed the rise of antipopes and internal conflicts within the Church. 

The century also witnessed the emergence of new and innovative centres of learning, such as the University of Paris and the University of Bologna. These were modelled on the schools of thought, learning and religion in the Middle East, particularly in historical cities, such as Alexandria (Egypt) and Baghdad (now the capital of modern Iraq). Following the works of scholars such as Peter Abelard and Peter Lombard, who brought the ideas of Greek philosophy into their critique and exposition of theological thought, an academic approach called scholastic theology emerged, which emphasised logical reasoning and the systematic presentation of Christian doctrine.

The 12th century was also a period of significant development and reform within monasticism, marked by the rise of new orders and internal debates about the balance between spiritual life and worldly involvement. Key events include the foundation of the Cistercian order, the spread of the Augustinian rule, and the emergence of the mendicant orders. The rise of the mendicant orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans, began to shift the focus of monasticism towards active ministry within the laity, preaching, and serving the poor. 

**1093:** The Benedictine monk Anselm succeeds Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury. Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109) is best known for his ontological argument for God\'s existence. His work bridges the gap between faith and reason. 

**1095:** Pope Urban II calls for the First Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land, following the violent entry of Turks into Jerusalem. He is supported by the influential cleric St Bernard of Clairvaux. However, the Crusade (which means, The Way of the Cross) did not leave for another four years in 1099). It was the embryo of the later concept of Holy War.

**1098:** The Cistercian order, known for its reforms, is founded at Citeaux. The order signified a return to the original, stricter interpretation of the Benedictine rule and a focus on manual labour and simple living. 

**1099:** Pope Paschall II is invested. He campaigned for the abolition of the lay investiture of bishops, without success in Germany, but with some success in England and France.

**1101: **Antipope Theodoric and Antipope Adalbert are deposed by Pope Paschal II.

**1113:** The Knights Hospitaller (Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem), a Catholic military order, was founded in Jerusalem and was quickly confirmed by Papal bull by Pope Paschal II the same year. Its headquarters remained in Jerusalem until 1291, after which it transferred to various castles throughout the Greek island archipelago, finally settling in Malta in 1530. The order rose at the height of the reformist Cluniac movement within the Benedictine monastic order, which focused on fostering piety and care for the poor. Within 20 years it had become a military order, under its own papal charter, charged with the defence of the Holy Land -- a task it fulfilled in the region until the Siege of Acre in 1291, which resulted in the reconquest of the Holy Land by Seljuk Turks.

They were given the Cistercian white mantle with a red cross by Pope Honorius II. Later, Pope Eugenius III sanctioned the use of the order's Eight-Pointed Cross. The Knights Templar became a significant military force in the Crusader States, amassing considerable wealth, with which the order established a network of command and administrative centres across Europe. By the 14th century, their influence and power had waned as the Crusader presence in the Holy Land diminished and King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the Templars, orchestrated their downfall. He accused them of heresy and other crimes, leading to their arrest and torture. Under pressure from King Philip, the order was officially suppressed by Pope Clement V in 1312. The order's end came when its Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake in Paris in 1314. The order's sudden and dramatic end has fuelled many a conspiracy theory that persist to the present day.

**1118:** Benedictine monk and chancellor of Pope Paschall II, Giovanni Caetano, was voted in as pope, taking the name Gelasius II. However, he only lasted a year. He was opposed by a powerful faction of bishops and the Salian Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. Soon after his election, he was kidnapped by Cencio II Frangipane, on behalf of the Emperor, but was freed by a popular uprising. He wasn't free for long. Henry drove him from Rome, pronounced his election void and set up Maurice Bourdin, the Archbishop of Braga (Spain) as antipope, under the moniker Gregory VIII. In exile, Gelasius took holy orders and excommunicated Henry and the antipope. Later the same year he left for France, ending up at the Abbey of Cluny, where he hoped to call for a synod to resolve the contest for the investiture as pope. As the new year turned, he fell ill and died before a council could be convened.

**1119**: Gelasius II was succeeded by Callistus II, who managed to gain control of the papal investiture process from the German Holy Roman Emperor Henry V at the Concordat of Worms. The Concordat, signed in 1122, was an agreement between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope that ended the long-standing dispute over who had the authority to appoint bishops and other church officials. The agreement established a distinction between spiritual and secular authority in the appointment process. 

**1120:** Peter Abelard's *Sic et non* manuscript began to be copied and distributed. The work explored theological contradictions. Abelard\'s work is one of the first examples of the scholastic method, which involved examining arguments for and against a proposition to arrive at a better understanding of truth. *Sic et Non* was influential in shaping the development of scholastic theology and logic, despite not being formally published.  

**1123:** The First Lateran Council was held. The Lateran councils were ecclesiastical councils or synods held in Rome in the Lateran Palace, adjoining the Lateran Basilica, founded by the Emperor Constantine in the fourth century. It is also the seat of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope). It became a favoured place for ecclesiastic councils, especially in the Medieval period.

**1124:** Honorius II becomes pope. Honorius II\'s election was tumultuous. Initially, Cardinal Teobaldo Boccapeccora was elected, but a faction led by Roberto Frangipani opposed this and favoured Lamberto Scannabecchi, who eventually became Pope Honorius II. By 1124, there were two great factions dominating local politics in Rome: the Frangipani family, which controlled the region around the fortified Colosseum and supported the northern cardinals, and the Pierleoni family, which controlled the Tiber Island and the fortress of the Theatre of Marcellus and supported the Italian cardinals. Although the rule of Honorius was marked by a talent for diplomacy, controversy haunted his papacy. Even so, he oversaw a period of spiritual renewal in the church.

**1130: **Peter of Bruys, a critic of the Catholic Church, is burned at the stake**.**

**1130:** Gregorio Papereschi is voted in as pope, taking the name Innocent II. Like his predecessor Honorius II, his election was mired in controversy. Elected by a minority, the favoured candidate was Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni, who declared himself pope, taking the name Anacletus II. Innocent was hastily consecrated, but by June 1130 Anacletus forced him to flee to France. However, interventions by the powerful Archbishop St. Norbert of Magdeburg, Saxony, and the highly regarded Abbot St. Bernard of Clairvaux, swayed both the French Church and King Henry I of England, who took Innocent's side. Norbert also won over the German Church and garnered support from the German king Lothar II/III. Once secure in his tenure, Innocent II continued many of the reforms proposed by Gregory the Great.

**1139:** The Second Lateran Council was held. Although it was the 10^th^ ecumenical council recognised by the Church, it was nonetheless controversial. It was convened by Pope Innocent II, in the hope of neutralising the aftereffects of the schism, or split in the church following the death of Pope Honorius II in 1130. Moreover, the papal election held that year which resulted in the antipope Anacletus II.

**1142: **Peter Abelard\'s letters with Heloise are written.

**1144: **The Basilica of Saint-Denis, a major building in the new Gothic style, is completed.

**1148:** Peter Lombard\'s *Sentences*, a four-book compendium of Christian theology, was first published in the mid-12th century, specifically between 1148 and 1151. It quickly became a standard textbook in medieval universities and significantly influenced theological thought for centuries.** **While teaching at Notre Dame, Lombard composed *Sentences* in two phases in the 1150s. The work is systematic, explaining various aspects of Christian theology, drawing on patristic interpretations of Scripture. *Sentences* became one of the most important religious texts of the Middle Ages. It was widely used in theological studies in universities, with students expected to lecture on it and write commentaries.** **

![A letter with a painting on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.](media/image3.jpeg){width="1.96875in" height="3.1458333333333335in"}**1153:** Saint, Cistercian abbot and doctor, Bernard of Clairvaux dies. St Bernard of Clairvaux was one of the most famous, charming and dynamic figures of the Middle Ages. He played a pivotal role in the development of the Cistercian Order, and was an active participant in political and ecclesiastical affairs. He was an avid supporter of the Crusades, for instance. Saint Bernard left a considerable body of work which include over 300 letters and sermons, mystical works and devotions to the Virgin. He famously penned The Memorare. Bernard was opposed to scholasticism, which grew in popularity following the publication of works by Peter Abelard and Peter Lombard. St Bernard thought the critical philosophy of scholasticism undermined God's mysteries. He thought that proper understanding of the divine came through prayer and charity, not rational argument.

**1155:** The Carmelites were founded by hermits and monks, who built a shrine to devoted to Our Lady. The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, St. Albert, gave the hermits a Rule of Life based on Scripture. Over the next two hundred years the Carmelites established their headquarters in the Stella Maris monastery on Mount Carmel in northern Israel. The order eventually evolved into two main branches: the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance and the Discalced Carmelites. The Discalced Carmelites were founded in the 16th century by St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross. This order emphasised a more contemplative and secluded life, exemplified in St Teresa's main work: *The Interior Castle*. The Carmelites have a strong devotion to Our Lady, and to the prophet Elijah. 

**1163:** Construction of Notre Dame de Paris begins.

**1173:** The Waldensians, a reformist group, are founded. 

**1179:** The Catholic Third Lateran Council was held. All Church historians agree, this was a significant synod. Two years earlier, the treaty called the Peace of Venice was signed that ended the conflict between Pope Alexander II and the Emperor Frederick I, called Barbarossa. The row ostensibly centred on the validity of the papacy itself. After Pope Adrian IV died in 1159, two popes were elected by competing groups of cardinals. Roland of Siena, who took the name of Alexander III, was voted in by the majority of cardinals. However, Octavian of Rome, supported by Frederick, pressured a small group of cardinals to vote him, pope and took the name Victor IV. To support his puppet pope Frederick, who also wanted control of the papacy, declared war upon the Italian states. A serious schism arose out of this conflict, and after Victor IV\'s death in 1164, two further so-called antipopes were nominated in opposition to Alexander III: Paschal III (1164--1168) and Callistus III (1168--1178). Eventually, at the Peace of Venice, Alexander gained important ground, promising Frederick that he would summon an ecumenical council, which then confirmed his supremacy as pope. The same synod is also noted for its condemnation of Catharism, which resulted in its violent oppression; its legislation against sodomy; and its enshrinement of the rule that only cardinals can elect a pope and only then with a two-thirds majority for the vote to be valid. Any pope arising out of an alternate system would be automatically excommunicated.

**1191:** The Teutonic Knights the Catholic military order was founded in Acre, which was then part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Formally called the *Orden der Brüder vom Deutschen Haus der Heiligen Maria in Jerusalem*  (Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem) its job was to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land and to establish hospitals for the sick and the poor. The order started to play an important role in Outremer (the general name for the Crusader states), controlling the port tolls of Acre. In 1211, the Order was invited to the Burzenland (southeastern Transylvania) to help defend the southeastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Cumans. As the Order gradually pushed back the invaders, King Andrew II of Hungary became concerned he was losing influence. So, in 1225, after Pope Honorius III\'s papal bull claiming his authority over the Order\'s territory in Transylvania and its tax exemption toward the king, Andrew expelled the Order from his country. The order was repeatedly used by the Church and the Holy Roman Emperors to repel invaders and subdue rebellions, mainly in northern and eastern Europe. Rather like the Templars, the Teutonic Knights amassed large fortunes, through its control of port cities and trade with the Hanseatic League. Unlike the Templars and Hospitallers, history was much kinder to the Teutonic Knights, which remained powerful up to the end of the 19^th^ century as a semi-religious military force. However, the Reformation, the rise of Protestantism and later the empire-builder Napolean hamstrung much of their power and influence. However, the Order continued to exist as a charitable and ceremonial body. It was outlawed by Nazi Germany in 1938, but re-established in 1945. Today it operates primarily with charitable aims in Central Europe.
