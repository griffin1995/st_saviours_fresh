  July 3^rd^ was the feast day of St Thomas the Apostle. As July opens and the Feast of the Sacred Heart brought June to a close, we look at the nature and constancy of our faith. I think St Thomas's natural disbelief that Christ had risen from the tomb is an example of the inner turmoil in our hearts as and when we face challenging times.

**\[TITLE\] Spiritual Thought for July**

Imagine the shock, fear, hurt and loneliness of St Thomas in the days after the Crucifixion, one of the most horrid and painful deaths devised by the Romans. Returning to the home of the Apostles and hearing that Jesus is in fact risen and the no doubt frantic exclamations of his fellow disciplines, is it unreasonable to surmise that St Thomas would express surprise and doubt? Wouldn't it be natural for a practical man to state that he wouldn't believe it unless he could see for himself the risen Christ and touch his wounds?

And then, the denouement. That moment when Christ appeared and kindly laid his wound for Thomas to see and touch, and the heartrending moment when Thomas falls on his knees and in awe cries, "My Lord and my God!" It is a moment of both sorrow and hope. Sorrow for the momentary lapse in faith, and hope of an entirely new tomorrow. It was a moment of full realisation that the man he had shared troubles, debate, bread and wine with, was truly the Son of God. That defining moment opened the gate to eternity for Thomas as he literally touched the divine. It was transformative. It would turn his mind and his heart from earth to Heaven, from doubt to certainty, from independence to submission to God's design and set his pilgrim journey on a path to missionary glory.

The theology of \"Doubting Thomas\" emphases that true faith often requires personal evidence, but is ultimately about believing without seeing. The story, found in  the Gospel of John, Chapter 20. highlights the human need for proof, the grace of Jesus in providing it, and a profound declaration of faith when Thomas witnesses the resurrected Christ. It serves as a bridge between the original witnesses and later believers, while also affirming that faith without direct sight is blessed. Thomas\'s scepticism is presented as a rational and understandable desire for proof, mirroring the physical experience his fellow apostles had already received. He famously stated, \"Unless I see the mark of the nails, and I put my hand into his side, I will not believe\".

For us today, the story connects the original witnesses (the other ten disciples) to future believers (like us) who cannot have the same direct, sensory experience of Jesus. The narrative culminates with Jesus\'s blessing for those who have not seen and yet believe. This is a core tenet of the Christian faith, affirming that belief is possible and valuable without physical proof.

Our faith is Christ centric. We believe that the only way to the Father is through Christ, His Son. It's in many ways a happy faith; it has a happy ending for the constant and the faithful; a life of eternity in Heaven. It's also a challenging faith. One that requires repeated commitment. I'm reminded of a well known corporate maxim: "Success is never owned, it is only rented and rent is due every day." Our faith is like that too. Through good times and bad we are asked to renew our commitment and love of God, and live that commitment in big ways and small, in every way, every day. That's constancy. That's true belief. God bless you.
