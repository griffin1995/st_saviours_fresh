**\[TITLE\] Spiritual Thought For The Month Of February**

At this time of year many young people in St Saviour's Parish will assume the sacrament of Confirmation. What does this mean? The sacrament of Confirmation is conferred through the anointing with chrism on the forehead, which is done by the laying on of the hand, and through the words: *\'Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti\'* \[Be sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.\].\" it is fitting to consider the sign of anointing and what it signifies and imprints: a spiritual seal. The Catechism of the Church tells us: \"It is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\"

A seal is a symbol of a person, a sign of personal authority, or ownership of an object. The seal of the Holy Spirit marks our total belonging to Christ, our enrolment in his service. Because of this meaning, it cannot be approached lightly, as just another ceremony in the Catholic liturgy. Confirmation must be done willingly and with aforethought. The celebrant must understand the mystical bond that is created by Confirmation between the himself or herself and the divine before acceptance. The bishop asks if the celebrant accepts the seal through anointing and the celebrant by stepping up to be anointed shows his or her desire to be sealed. \
\
There is also a historical aspect to Confirmation. It is a practice that joins us to our Catholic antecedents who also accepted the seal of the Holy Spirit going back thousands of years. Anointing itself is a long-recognised practice replete with meaning. Oil is a sign of abundance and joy; it cleanses (anointing before and after a bath) and limbers the body (the anointing of athletes and wrestlers). Oil is a sign of healing, since it is soothing to bruises and wounds; and it helps the skin, making it radiant with beauty, health, and strength.

The chrism the Church uses is a mixture of pure oil of olives and balsam that is blessed by a bishop. Used in sacraments such as Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders, it is also used in the consecration of churches, chalices, patens, altars, altar-stones, and in the solemn blessing of bells and baptismal water. The oil signifies the copious outpouring of grace and strength. Balsam typifies the sweetness of Christian virtue, which protects from the corruption of sin\
 \
Anointing with chrism oil has parallel meanings in the sacramental life of the Church. The pre-baptismal anointing with the oil of catechumens signifies cleansing and strengthening; the anointing of the sick (at our afternoon First Friday masses) expresses healing and comfort. The post-baptismal anointing with sacred chrism in Confirmation and ordination is the sign of consecration. By Confirmation Christians, that is, those who are anointed, share more completely in the mission of Jesus Christ and the fullness of the Holy Spirit with which he is filled, so that their lives may give off \"the aroma of Christ.\"

The Liturgy of Confirmation is then the next important step in the life of a Catholic that began with Baptism. In the ceremony of Confirmation confirmands are invited to renew their baptismal promises and the profession of faith. It marks a special turning point in our lives, when we are old enough to understand the glory, tenets and demands of our faith and yet still walk towards the celebrant to accept the seal of the Holy Spirit. It confirms not only our belief in the divine, but also our free acceptance of the expectations this puts on us as Catholics. This is love.

............................................................................................................................................................ \
In the sacrament of Confirmation, the bishop extends his hands over the whole group of the confirmands. Since the time of the apostles this gesture has signified the gift of the Spirit. The bishop invokes the outpouring of the Spirit in these words:\
 \
*All-powerful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by water and the Holy Spirit\
you freed your sons and daughters from sin and gave them new life.\
Send your Holy Spirit upon them to be their helper and guide.\
Give them the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of right judgment and courage,\
the spirit of knowledge and reverence.\
Fill them with the spirit of wonder and awe in your presence. We ask this through Christ our Lord.*

As we come to witness the confirmation of our young parishioners let us ponder the deep significance of these words in our hearts.
