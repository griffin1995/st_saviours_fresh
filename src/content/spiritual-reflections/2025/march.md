description: |
  In March 2025, the Catholic Church celebrates several important feast days, including the Solemnity of the Annunciation, the feast of St. Patrick, and the start of Lent with Ash Wednesday. Additionally, the liturgical calendar includes the Sundays of Lent, the feasts of the Saints of the early church, Perpetua and Felicity, and of course, St. Joseph. In fact, the month of March is dedicated to Saint Joseph, the foster father of Jesus and spouse of the Virgin Mary. Catholics are encouraged to deepen their devotion to St. Joseph during this month, reflecting on his virtues and seeking his intercession. The major feast day associated with this devotion is the Solemnity of St. Joseph on March 19th.

**\[TITLE\] Spiritual Thought For The Month Of March**

Lent begins in early March this year. As we celebrate Ash Wednesday on the March 5^th^ and enter into an extended period of spiritual reflection, it might be useful to think on the themes of redemption and salvation and what they mean for us as Catholics. On paper, redemption and salvation go hand in hand. In real life they do not. Although these are words which are often used interchangeably by Christians there are, in fact, key differences between the two.

The word redemption is derived from the Latin Vulgate word *redemptio*; a rendering of the Hebrew word *kopher* and the Greek word *lytron* which means the price of ransom in the Old Testament. 

According to the Catechism, redemption is the act of Christ giving his life as a ransom for humanity\'s sins. This act of redemption allows people to be freed from sin and restored to a relationship with God. Redemption is the first step of salvation and the first part of our life as a child of God, which enables us to enjoy the riches of His Grace.

However, our lives as children of God does not begin and end in redemption. After we are redeemed from our sins and reconciled with God, we begin the process of salvation. In the Council of Trent, salvation from sin begins with the grace of God touching a sinner's heart and calling him to repent. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines salvation as the opportunity for humans to be saved from sin through faith in Jesus Christ. The Catechism also states that the Catholic Church is the universal hope for salvation. 

The grace of salvation is a product of the love and mercy of God and it is our choice whether to receive this grace or reject it. As Catholics we believe in the revelation and promises of God, we fear God's justice and we hope in His mercy, we trust that God will be merciful to us for Christ's sake, we begin to love God as the source of all justice and we begin to hate sin. 

If we choose to receive grace, we choose a life aligned with the will of God but it we don't receive it, we remain in a life of sin. This involves the sanctification and renewal of our inner selves through our voluntary reception of God's grace and gifts. This inner transformation will manifest in the way we live our lives and how we treat others. Salvation therefore is not a one-time event. It is not simply accepting the grace of God, it involves constantly choosing a Christian way of life and following the teachings of the church. 

Salvation and redemption are beautiful gifts that we are all very blessed to receive. Lent is the perfect time for us to reflect on this gift and the positive affirmation we each make to accept the Grace of God.

PRAYER BEFORE A CRUCIFIX

One of the beautiful prayers of the Church is the Prayer before a Crucifix. Say *Our Father, Hail Mary* and the *Glory Be* for the Catholic Church and the intentions of the Holy Father. A plenary indulgence, may be gained by those who shall say this prayer with devotion before an image of our crucified Redeemer after the Mass each Friday in Lent. A partial indulgence may also be gained for each devout recitation.

*Behold O king and sweet Jesus, I cast myself on my knees in thy sight; and with the most fervent desire of my soul, I pray and beseech Thee to impress upon my heart lively sentiments of faith, hope, and charity, with true repentance for my sins and firm desire of amendment. Whilst with deep affection and grief of soul I ponder within myself and mentally contemplate Thy five most precious wounds, having before mine eyes that which David spoke in prophecy of Thee, my good Jesus: They have pierced My hands and My feet, they have numbered all My bones."*
