    title: "The Catholic Church In The 12^th^ Century: a timeline of key events\n",
    description: "The end of the 11th century and the start of the 12^th^ century was a watershed for the Catholic Church. Major changes in the European and Near Eastern political landscape had far-reaching implications for Catholics of the period. Below is a timeline highlighting some of the highlights of the period, which affected the Catholic Church and the principal theologians and popes of the day. They are and will be covered in more detail in subsequent articles and discussions.\n",
    content: `<p><img src="media/image1.png" alt="A group of people in armor with spears and spears"></p>
<p>Spiritually, key figures such as the Italian monk and statesman Lanfranc, and the English Benedictine monk Anselm of Canterbury, led church reforms in England, including the reorganisation of dioceses and establishing firmer monastic rules. Anselm also wrote influential works, such as <em>Why Did God Become a Man</em>? exploring the reasons for Christ&#39;s death. Polyphonic singing emerged, replacing Gregorian Chant, and the harp arrived in Europe.</p>
<p>The 12th century saw a series of significant popes who navigated complex political landscapes and religious reforms. Some notable figures include Paschal II, Calixtus II, Innocent II, and Alexander III.  Other notable popes of the 12th century include Honorius II, Celestine II, Lucius II, Eugene III, Anastasius IV, and Lucius III, each contributing to the complex history of the papacy during this period. This era also witnessed the rise of antipopes and internal conflicts within the Church.</p>
<p>The century also witnessed the emergence of new and innovative centres of learning, such as the University of Paris and the University of Bologna. These were modelled on the schools of thought, learning and religion in the Middle East, particularly in historical cities, such as Alexandria (Egypt) and Baghdad (now the capital of modern Iraq). Following the works of scholars such as Peter Abelard and Peter Lombard, who brought the ideas of Greek philosophy into their critique and exposition of theological thought, an academic approach called scholastic theology emerged, which emphasised logical reasoning and the systematic presentation of Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>The 12th century was also a period of significant development and reform within monasticism, marked by the rise of new orders and internal debates about the balance between spiritual life and worldly involvement. Key events include the foundation of the Cistercian order, the spread of the Augustinian rule, and the emergence of the mendicant orders. The rise of the mendicant orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans, began to shift the focus of monasticism towards active ministry within the laity, preaching, and serving the poor.</p>
<p><strong>1093:</strong> The Benedictine monk Anselm succeeds Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury. Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109) is best known for his ontological argument for God&#39;s existence. His work bridges the gap between faith and reason.</p>
<p><strong>1095:</strong> Pope Urban II calls for the First Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land, following the violent entry of Turks into Jerusalem. He is supported by the influential cleric St Bernard of Clairvaux. However, the Crusade (which means, The Way of the Cross) did not leave for another four years in 1099). It was the embryo of the later concept of Holy War.</p>
<p><strong>1098:</strong> The Cistercian order, known for its reforms, is founded at Citeaux. The order signified a return to the original, stricter interpretation of the Benedictine rule and a focus on manual labour and simple living.</p>
<p><strong>1099:</strong> Pope Paschall II is invested. He campaigned for the abolition of the lay investiture of bishops, without success in Germany, but with some success in England and France.</p>
<p>**1101: **Antipope Theodoric and Antipope Adalbert are deposed by Pope Paschal II.</p>
<p><strong>1113:</strong> The Knights Hospitaller (Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem), a Catholic military order, was founded in Jerusalem and was quickly confirmed by Papal bull by Pope Paschal II the same year. Its headquarters remained in Jerusalem until 1291, after which it transferred to various castles throughout the Greek island archipelago, finally settling in Malta in 1530. The order rose at the height of the reformist Cluniac movement within the Benedictine monastic order, which focused on fostering piety and care for the poor. Within 20 years it had become a military order, under its own papal charter, charged with the defence of the Holy Land -- a task it fulfilled in the region until the Siege of Acre in 1291, which resulted in the reconquest of the Holy Land by Seljuk Turks.</p>
<p><img src="media/image2.png" alt="A statue of a person in a robe holding a sword and shield"><strong>1118:</strong> The Knights Templar were founded to defend the Holy Land around 1119 in Jerusalem, initially consisting of nine French knights. Granted quarters in a wing of the royal palace near the Temple of Solomon, their quarters helped frame the order&#39;s name as the Knights Templar (more formally, the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon). They were given the Cistercian white mantle with a red cross by Pope Honorius II. Later, Pope Eugenius III sanctioned the use of the order&#39;s Eight-Pointed Cross. The Knights Templar became a significant military force in the Crusader States, amassing considerable wealth, with which the order established a network of command and administrative centres across Europe. By the 14th century, their influence and power had waned as the Crusader presence in the Holy Land diminished and King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the Templars, orchestrated their downfall. He accused them of heresy and other crimes, leading to their arrest and torture. Under pressure from King Philip, the order was officially suppressed by Pope Clement V in 1312. The order&#39;s end came when its Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake in Paris in 1314. The order&#39;s sudden and dramatic end has fuelled many a conspiracy theory that persist to the present day.</p>
<p><strong>1118:</strong> Benedictine monk and chancellor of Pope Paschall II, Giovanni Caetano, was voted in as pope, taking the name Gelasius II. However, he only lasted a year. He was opposed by a powerful faction of bishops and the Salian Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. Soon after his election, he was kidnapped by Cencio II Frangipane, on behalf of the Emperor, but was freed by a popular uprising. He wasn&#39;t free for long. Henry drove him from Rome, pronounced his election void and set up Maurice Bourdin, the Archbishop of Braga (Spain) as antipope, under the moniker Gregory VIII. In exile, Gelasius took holy orders and excommunicated Henry and the antipope. Later the same year he left for France, ending up at the Abbey of Cluny, where he hoped to call for a synod to resolve the contest for the investiture as pope. As the new year turned, he fell ill and died before a council could be convened.</p>
<p><strong>1119</strong>: Gelasius II was succeeded by Callistus II, who managed to gain control of the papal investiture process from the German Holy Roman Emperor Henry V at the Concordat of Worms. The Concordat, signed in 1122, was an agreement between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope that ended the long-standing dispute over who had the authority to appoint bishops and other church officials. The agreement established a distinction between spiritual and secular authority in the appointment process.</p>
<p><strong>1120:</strong> Peter Abelard&#39;s <em>Sic et non</em> manuscript began to be copied and distributed. The work explored theological contradictions. Abelard&#39;s work is one of the first examples of the scholastic method, which involved examining arguments for and against a proposition to arrive at a better understanding of truth. <em>Sic et Non</em> was influential in shaping the development of scholastic theology and logic, despite not being formally published.</p>
<p><strong>1123:</strong> The First Lateran Council was held. The Lateran councils were ecclesiastical councils or synods held in Rome in the Lateran Palace, adjoining the Lateran Basilica, founded by the Emperor Constantine in the fourth century. It is also the seat of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope). It became a favoured place for ecclesiastic councils, especially in the Medieval period.</p>
<p><strong>1124:</strong> Honorius II becomes pope. Honorius II&#39;s election was tumultuous. Initially, Cardinal Teobaldo Boccapeccora was elected, but a faction led by Roberto Frangipani opposed this and favoured Lamberto Scannabecchi, who eventually became Pope Honorius II. By 1124, there were two great factions dominating local politics in Rome: the Frangipani family, which controlled the region around the fortified Colosseum and supported the northern cardinals, and the Pierleoni family, which controlled the Tiber Island and the fortress of the Theatre of Marcellus and supported the Italian cardinals. Although the rule of Honorius was marked by a talent for diplomacy, controversy haunted his papacy. Even so, he oversaw a period of spiritual renewal in the church.</p>
<p><strong>1130: <strong>Peter of Bruys, a critic of the Catholic Church, is burned at the stake</strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1130:</strong> Gregorio Papereschi is voted in as pope, taking the name Innocent II. Like his predecessor Honorius II, his election was mired in controversy. Elected by a minority, the favoured candidate was Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni, who declared himself pope, taking the name Anacletus II. Innocent was hastily consecrated, but by June 1130 Anacletus forced him to flee to France. However, interventions by the powerful Archbishop St. Norbert of Magdeburg, Saxony, and the highly regarded Abbot St. Bernard of Clairvaux, swayed both the French Church and King Henry I of England, who took Innocent&#39;s side. Norbert also won over the German Church and garnered support from the German king Lothar II/III. Once secure in his tenure, Innocent II continued many of the reforms proposed by Gregory the Great.</p>
<p><strong>1139:</strong> The Second Lateran Council was held. Although it was the 10^th^ ecumenical council recognised by the Church, it was nonetheless controversial. It was convened by Pope Innocent II, in the hope of neutralising the aftereffects of the schism, or split in the church following the death of Pope Honorius II in 1130. Moreover, the papal election held that year which resulted in the antipope Anacletus II.</p>
<p>**1142: **Peter Abelard&#39;s letters with Heloise are written.</p>
<p>**1144: **The Basilica of Saint-Denis, a major building in the new Gothic style, is completed.</p>
<p><strong>1148:</strong> Peter Lombard&#39;s <em>Sentences</em>, a four-book compendium of Christian theology, was first published in the mid-12th century, specifically between 1148 and 1151. It quickly became a standard textbook in medieval universities and significantly influenced theological thought for centuries.** <strong>While teaching at Notre Dame, Lombard composed <em>Sentences</em> in two phases in the 1150s. The work is systematic, explaining various aspects of Christian theology, drawing on patristic interpretations of Scripture. <em>Sentences</em> became one of the most important religious texts of the Middle Ages. It was widely used in theological studies in universities, with students expected to lecture on it and write commentaries.</strong> **</p>
<p><img src="media/image3.jpeg" alt="A letter with a painting on it AI-generated content may be incorrect."><strong>1153:</strong> Saint, Cistercian abbot and doctor, Bernard of Clairvaux dies. St Bernard of Clairvaux was one of the most famous, charming and dynamic figures of the Middle Ages. He played a pivotal role in the development of the Cistercian Order, and was an active participant in political and ecclesiastical affairs. He was an avid supporter of the Crusades, for instance. Saint Bernard left a considerable body of work which include over 300 letters and sermons, mystical works and devotions to the Virgin. He famously penned The Memorare. Bernard was opposed to scholasticism, which grew in popularity following the publication of works by Peter Abelard and Peter Lombard. St Bernard thought the critical philosophy of scholasticism undermined God&#39;s mysteries. He thought that proper understanding of the divine came through prayer and charity, not rational argument.</p>
<p><strong>1155:</strong> The Carmelites were founded by hermits and monks, who built a shrine to devoted to Our Lady. The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, St. Albert, gave the hermits a Rule of Life based on Scripture. Over the next two hundred years the Carmelites established their headquarters in the Stella Maris monastery on Mount Carmel in northern Israel. The order eventually evolved into two main branches: the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance and the Discalced Carmelites. The Discalced Carmelites were founded in the 16th century by St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross. This order emphasised a more contemplative and secluded life, exemplified in St Teresa&#39;s main work: <em>The Interior Castle</em>. The Carmelites have a strong devotion to Our Lady, and to the prophet Elijah.</p>
<p><strong>1163:</strong> Construction of Notre Dame de Paris begins.</p>
<p><strong>1173:</strong> The Waldensians, a reformist group, are founded.</p>
<p><strong>1179:</strong> The Catholic Third Lateran Council was held. All Church historians agree, this was a significant synod. Two years earlier, the treaty called the Peace of Venice was signed that ended the conflict between Pope Alexander II and the Emperor Frederick I, called Barbarossa. The row ostensibly centred on the validity of the papacy itself. After Pope Adrian IV died in 1159, two popes were elected by competing groups of cardinals. Roland of Siena, who took the name of Alexander III, was voted in by the majority of cardinals. However, Octavian of Rome, supported by Frederick, pressured a small group of cardinals to vote him, pope and took the name Victor IV. To support his puppet pope Frederick, who also wanted control of the papacy, declared war upon the Italian states. A serious schism arose out of this conflict, and after Victor IV&#39;s death in 1164, two further so-called antipopes were nominated in opposition to Alexander III: Paschal III (1164--1168) and Callistus III (1168--1178). Eventually, at the Peace of Venice, Alexander gained important ground, promising Frederick that he would summon an ecumenical council, which then confirmed his supremacy as pope. The same synod is also noted for its condemnation of Catharism, which resulted in its violent oppression; its legislation against sodomy; and its enshrinement of the rule that only cardinals can elect a pope and only then with a two-thirds majority for the vote to be valid. Any pope arising out of an alternate system would be automatically excommunicated.</p>
<p><strong>1191:</strong> The Teutonic Knights the Catholic military order was founded in Acre, which was then part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Formally called the <em>Orden der Brüder vom Deutschen Haus der Heiligen Maria in Jerusalem</em>  (Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem) its job was to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land and to establish hospitals for the sick and the poor. The order started to play an important role in Outremer (the general name for the Crusader states), controlling the port tolls of Acre. In 1211, the Order was invited to the Burzenland (southeastern Transylvania) to help defend the southeastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Cumans. As the Order gradually pushed back the invaders, King Andrew II of Hungary became concerned he was losing influence. So, in 1225, after Pope Honorius III&#39;s papal bull claiming his authority over the Order&#39;s territory in Transylvania and its tax exemption toward the king, Andrew expelled the Order from his country. The order was repeatedly used by the Church and the Holy Roman Emperors to repel invaders and subdue rebellions, mainly in northern and eastern Europe. Rather like the Templars, the Teutonic Knights amassed large fortunes, through its control of port cities and trade with the Hanseatic League. Unlike the Templars and Hospitallers, history was much kinder to the Teutonic Knights, which remained powerful up to the end of the 19^th^ century as a semi-religious military force. However, the Reformation, the rise of Protestantism and later the empire-builder Napolean hamstrung much of their power and influence. However, the Order continued to exist as a charitable and ceremonial body. It was outlawed by Nazi Germany in 1938, but re-established in 1945. Today it operates primarily with charitable aims in Central Europe.</p>`,

    title: "The Catholic Church In The 13^th^ Century: a timeline of key events\n",
    description: "In some respects, the 13th century is thought by historians to be the apogee of the High Middle Ages. In reality it was a mixed bag for the ordinary man. The Crusades were in full flow, and they helped build the sea powers of Venice and Genoa, and fuelled the early days of the Reconquista in Spain, but the Crusades had begun to lose steam in the Middle East. The papacy was at the height of its political and financial influence, with figures such as Innocent III wielding considerable religious power, often to the detriment of protestant groups, such as the Waldensians and new cults, such as the Cathars.\n",

<p>Monasticism, the rise of university cities across Europe and axial relationships with religious and educational institutions in Persia, Spain and Egypt, resulted in a fruitful flow of advancements in mathematics, logic, philosophy and theology. In Europe, at this time, Cambridge and Bologna in particular began to come to prominence. In particular, with the publication of treatise by theologians such as Peter Lombard, the scholastic critical model became a touchstone of intellectual argument and ideas. His ideas, as scholasticism began to dominate critical theological ideas, influenced Church doctors, such as Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Albertus Magnus. These theologians added to the heft that the Catholic Church wielded on history in the 13th century.</p>
<p>Scholasticism is a method of theological inquiry that emphasises logical reasoning and the use of dialectic to resolve theological questions. The method led to the development of organised and comprehensive theological systems, often beginning with arguments for the existence of God. Moreover, the rediscovery and assimilation of Aristotle&#39;s works, particularly by Aquinas, led to a more rational and philosophical approach to theology. Even so, the century didn&#39;t swallow Aristotelian thought wholesale. The influence of Averroes, Sigurt of Brabant and the publication of the Condemnation of 1277 by the Bishop of Paris, and the Condemnation of Paris in 1277, led to new lines of theological, philosophical and scientific enquiries. Alongside scholasticism, mystical theology also flourished, with figures like Bonaventure exploring the experiential aspects of faith.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the early 13^th^ century in England witnessed the first serious revolt of the elite against the irascible and unpredictable monarchy of John Lackland, which culminated in the signing of the Magna Carta and the foundations of the extraordinarily long road to modern-day democracy and advancements in legal systems and economics.</p>
<p>It was a century in which civilisations clashed: Christians v Muslims; Mongols v just about everyone in Eurasia. The rise and cruel expansion of the Mongol Empire, led by Genghis Khan and his sons, which, at its peak, would almost touch the gates of Vienna. The Mongol conquests significantly impacted the Muslim world, including the sack of Baghdad in 1258, which led to the decline of the Islamic Golden Age. For every action there is a opposite reaction and it applies to politics as much as science As the Abbasid empire was broken by the Khans, the Mamluk dynasty was established in Egypt. It marked a shift in power in the Middle East and also fuelled harassment of remnant Christian communities in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>With such a conflict ridden and dynamic century, no wonder that economic growth began to slow down as government resources were often redirected to fund defence. The century ended with the onset of the Great Famine.</p>
<p><strong>....................</strong></p>
<p><strong>1200</strong>: Albertus Magnus (1200-1280) is born. He would become, in turn, a Dominican friar, the teacher of Thomas Aquinas, and a prolific writer on various subjects, including theology and natural science.</p>
<p><strong>1202-1204</strong>: The catastrophic Fourth Crusade gets underway. It was supposed to recapture Jerusalem, what it did was fatally weaken the Byzantine Empire, as the crusading army sacked Constantinople and stayed there. Initially targeted at capturing Jerusalem, the Fourth Crusade resulted in the sack of Constantinople, significantly weakening the Byzantine Empire. There were many reasons for the attack. By the time the Crusaders got to Constantinople they had run out of money. Heavily reliant on Venice for transportation across the Mediterranean, the Venetians charged increasingly expensive carriage rates. Partners in the fourth crusade, the Venetians actively encouraged the Crusaders to attack the city in the hope of expanding their dominance of Mediterranean trade and at the same time increase their profits from the ill-advised venture. The administration of Constantinople was, albeit indirectly, also complicit in the city&#39;s sacking. The Byzantine prince, Alexios IV Angelus (son of the Emperor  calling upon the Fourth Crusade to help him gain power. Hungry for money, the Crusaders agreed, but then Alexios refused to pay for the favour. There were other reasons too: since the split between the eastern and western churches in 1054, over time religious and political differences regularly turned into antagonism. The sack of the city helped fire and deepen these divisions.</p>
<p><strong>1205:</strong> The Doge of Venice, Enrico Dandolo dies in Constantinople. Although blind, Dandolo, was a prominent leader of the fourth crusade and encouraged the sack of Constantinople, partly to eliminate it as a commercial rival of the city state of Venice. Interestingly, if you visit Hagia Sofia, you can still see the headstone of the tomb of Dandolo in one of the doorway of the mosque. His body was removed and likely destroyed when Mehmet the Conqueror took over the city in 1453.</p>
<p><strong>1206:</strong> Genghis Khan unites the Mongol tribes and establishes the Mongol Empire. Under leaders, such as Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan (Genghis Khan&#39;s grandson), and others, the Mongols expanded across Asia and into Eastern Europe, creating one of the largest contiguous land empires in history.</p>
<p><strong>1215:</strong> The First Baron&#39;s war in England breaks out. This first outbreak lasted about two years. The barons, led by Robert Fitzwalter, rebelled against the despotic and incompetent rule of King John I, the last of the sons of Henry II. The rule of King John I is often compared, negatively, to that of his father, Henry II, who established Angevin rule across England and much of France. King John had waged a series of conflicts against the French king, Philip II of France, gradually losing much of his family&#39;s land to the French monarch. John quickly acquired the nickname Lackland, in acknowledgement of his lack of military prowess. The King had also begun to row back from the agreement, known as Magna Carta, signed on June 15^th^ that year.</p>
<p><strong>1215:</strong> The Magna Carta was signed. A beautifully written copy of the Magna Carta can be seen in a glass case at Salisbury Cathedral. The tightly written charter is a document that outlines the protection of church rights and the protection of the barons from illegal imprisonment. Magna Carta held clauses that theoretically noticeably reduced the authority of the King, such as Clause 61, called the &#39;security clause&#39;, which allowed the barons to override the King at any time by means of force, a medieval legal process known as <em>distraint</em>. The charter also put limits on the feudal payments that landowners (essentially the barons) owed each year to the crown; and a confirmation of rights outlined in the Charter of Liberties. The Charter of Liberties, signed in 1100 by Henry I. The document addressed abuses of royal power by his predecessor William II (who was in fact, Henry&#39;s brother, William Rufus). It specifically forbade the over-taxation of the barons, the abuse of vacant parishes or sees, and the practices of simony (the sale of ecclesiastical privileges) and pluralism (the holding of more than one ecclesiastic position). As the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, who drafted Magna Carta, both charters covered almost identical rights. That might have been the case, but in the event, neither side kept to its terms. In the event, the charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Baron&#39;s War (<em>see entry above</em>). John died soon after, but after his death, the regency administration of his son (Henry III), reissued Magna Carta stripped of much of its content. Many years later, short of funds, Henry III reissued Magna Carta again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, Edward I, reissued the charter for the last time, in 1297, this time confirming it as part of English law. Now the charter is part of English heritage; but it set the stage for the eventual creation of an English parliament, which set the country on a long, tortuous road to democracy.</p>
<p><strong>1215:</strong> The Fourth Lateran Council, convened by Pope Innocent III, defined key doctrines. The council addressed a number of issues, including the sacraments, the role of the laity, the treatment of Jews and heretics, and the organisation of the church. The teachings of the Cathars and Waldensians were condemned, resulting in their hounding and persecution by the Church. Innocent also ordered a four-year truce among Christian rulers so that a new Crusade could be launched. The Orthodox churches do not accept any of the five Lateran councils as truly ecumenical. The decree mandating annual confession and the promotion of the doctrine of transubstantiation, raised the profile of the council in Catholic history. Transubstantiation is of particular import, as it raised to the status of miracle, the moment in the alteration of substance by which the bread and wine become in reality the body and blood of Jesus Christ. The council was years in preparation. Over 1200 abbots, priors and bishops attended, as did the representatives of Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor of the west. It was the most important council to have taken place, up to the calling of the Council of Trent in 1563, in response to the Reformation and the rise of Protestantism across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>1216:</strong> Innocent III (1198-1216) dies:</p>
<p><strong>1216:</strong> Lothario of Segni, known to us as Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) dies**.** Considered one of the most powerful Popes of the Middle Ages, Innocent III asserted papal authority over secular rulers and played a key role in the Fourth Crusade. Innocent greatly extended the scope of the Crusades, directing crusades against Muslim Iberia and the Holy Land as well as the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in southern France. He personally organised the Fourth Crusade of 1202--1204, which ended in the sack of Constantinople. Innocent III famously annulled the Magna Carta, likely because he believed that the revolt of the barons in England, violated not only the feudal rights of King John I, but also his own. England had been ceded as a papal fief by the King two years earlier, who was coming under pressure from his disaffected barons, and whose lands were steadily encroached upon by the French crown, taking advantage of his incompetence and weakness as a military leader. He agreed to become a vasal of the pope, which included an annual tribute of 1000 marks. The English barons were horrified by this development, but the agreement remained in place until 1365 when the English parliament declared the agreement invalid. Pope Innocent&#39;s commitment to reform resulted in the famous Fourth Lateran Council, which established important doctrines (transubstantiation among them) and a clampdown on simony. However, its pursuit of heretics and Jews rightly attracted criticism and controversy.</p>
<p><strong>1216:</strong> The Order of Preachers was founded. We know it today as the Dominican Order, founded by the Spanish priest Dominic de Guzman (1170-1221), in France. The order was quickly approved by Pope Honorius II (1216-1227), shortly before he died. The order was founded to combat heresy and to promote the study of theology. Several notable theologians have been Dominicans, including St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Albert the Great, sometimes called Simon Magnus (1200 to 1260), and St. Catherine of Siena (1347-1380. Other prominent figures include Cardinal Cajetan, John of St. Thomas, and more contemporary theologians such as the French priest Yves Congar (1904-1995) and the Peruvian liberation theologist Gustavo Gutiérrez (1928-1924).</p>
<p><strong>1221:</strong> Giovanni di Fidanza (1221--1274), known to history as Bonaventure, is born. He would become a Franciscan bishop, Minister General of the Franciscans, known as the Order of the Friars Minor and a cardinal. He is best known as a theologian and philosopher. also renowned for his influential writings, including <em>The Journey of the Mind into God,</em> and for his role in shaping Franciscan theology and spirituality. He was canonised by Pope Sixtus V, in 1588 and his feast day is July 15th.</p>
<p><strong>1220:</strong> On the feast of Pentecost in 1220 the first general chapter of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) was held at Bologna, and a system of democratic government of the monks, who were devoted to poverty and teaching. At the second general chapter, held on Pentecost in 1221, also at Bologna, the order was divided geographically into provinces. After a visit to Venice in 1221, Dominic died at Bologna. A great friend of St Francis, he was deeply influenced by the piety, simplicity and achievements of the Franciscan order, which he sought to replicate, although the order was characterised by a passionate devotion of the faith against the so-called heresies of the Cathars and Waldensians, who the Dominicans helped to suppress, rarely in a kind or sympathetic way. The rise of so many Dominican theologians at the height of the Medieval period however, helped soften the image of the order.</p>
<p><strong>1221:</strong> St Dominic dies on August 6th 1221, in Bologna, Italy, and was canonised on July 3rd, <strong>1223:</strong> The Franciscan Order, founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, received formal papal approval.</p>
<p><strong>1225:</strong> Thomas Aquinas (1225--1274) was born. He would grow up to become one of the most famous doctors of the Church and influencer in the Medieval period. His stature as an intellectual helped to soften the image of the Dominicans, who would be regularly associated with the callous suppression of heretics in the 13th and 14th centuries. He became celebrated for his theology and philosophical works. He took the scholastic method to a new level and took his inspirations from leading philosophers of ancient Greece. He is regularly invoked by leading Catholic influencers even in the 21st century, by luminaries such as Pope Benedict XIII and Bishop Baron.</p>
<p><strong>1226:</strong> Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone (c.1181 --1226), better known as Francis of Assisi, dies. Canonised in 1228 by Pope Gregory IX, he is one of the most beloved of saints and alongside St Catherine of Siena is the patron saint of Italy. Commonly portrayed wearing a brown habit with a rope tied around his waist, by the 13^th^ century Italian painter Giotto, the rope is regularly featured as consisting of three knots which represent poverty, chastity, and obedience. His sanctity was defined in his lifetime by the stigmata.</p>
<p><strong>1227:</strong> Honorius III (1216-1227) dies. Best known for approving the founding of the Franciscan and Dominican order, Pope Honorius III continued the reforms instigated by Pope Innocent II. He also supported the build-up by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II&#39;s efforts to recover the Holy Land from Muslim control, sometimes known as the Fifth Crusade, specifically Emperor Frederick II&#39;s crusade, which was launched in 1228, some months after the death of Honorius III. He also was a strong supporter of the 20 year long crusade against the Albigensians in southern France. for his strong support of the Crusades.</p>
<p><strong>1227:</strong> Gregory IX (1227-1241) succeeds Honorius III as pope. Pope Gregory IX is known for two important developments. First, he ordered the first complete collection of papal decretals, called the Corpus Iuris Canonici, a code of Catholic canon law, which remained a foundation of ecclesiastic law until 1918. Decretals are canonical epistles, written by the pope either alone, or with cardinals, that determine and answer a controversy within the Church&#39;s teaching or administration. His second major act was to establish the so called Papal Inquisition; a series of institutional measures established to combat heresy and enforce religious conformity dating from 1233. There had been other papal enquiries, called inquisitions, but this took the term to a new level. It was centralised, it appointed special inquisitors, selected from religious orders, such as the Dominicans, who were empowered to investigate and prosecute heretics, and under certain conditions apply torture. In 20^th^ century eyes, it was not one of the Church&#39;s finest moments.</p>
<p><strong>1250:</strong> The Mamluk Sultanate is founded in Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>1253:</strong> Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175-1253), the English statesman, theologian, and scientist, known for his work on optics and his influence on the development of English theology dies.</p>
<p><strong>1258:</strong> The Mongol conquest of Baghdad, effectively ending the Abbasid Caliphate.</p>
<p><strong>1259:</strong> Treaty of Paris is signed between Louis IX of France and Henry III of England.</p>
<p><strong>1265:</strong> Simon de Montfort convenes the first English Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>1271-1295:</strong> Marco Polo travels to China, documenting his experiences.</p>
<p><strong>1274:</strong> The Second Council of Lyons, aiming to reconcile the Eastern and Western churches, but ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>1277:</strong> The Condemnation of 1277. With so many theological lines of enquiry influenced by Aristotle in the 12^th^ century, it was inevitable that at some point, there would be blowback. In 1277, the Bishop of Paris, Étienne Tempier, issued a treatise, attacking some 219 propositions stemming from Aristotelian thought that was influencing theological debate at the University of Paris. Aristotle&#39;s treatises, such as Physics, and On the Soul, were by 1277 translated into Latin and included in the study curriculum at the university. Some interpretations of Aristotle&#39;s teaching, particularly on natural causes and determinism, clashed with Christian teachings on free will, divine creation, and the possibility of miracles.  The condemnation was not a blanket ban on Aristotle&#39;s works, but rather a targeted response to specific interpretations and their perceived implications. It also asserted God&#39;s absolute power over creation, the operation of free will over environmental determinism, and the immortality of the soul (<em>please see the entries for Siger of Brabant and Averroes</em>). The condemnation marked a turning point in scholastic philosophy, encouraging a move away from strict adherence to Aristotelian principles and a greater emphasis on divine omnipotence and contingency. It led to a re-evaluation of Aristotelian philosophy and its compatibility with Christian doctrine. Many centuries later, science scholars such as Pierre Duhem (1861-1916), a leader in the study of thermodynamics, argued that the condemnation of 1277 marked a turning point in the development of modern science by encouraging a more critical approach to Aristotle.</p>
<p><strong>1284:</strong> Siger of Brabant (c. 1240--1284) dies. A controversial figure associated with the &#39;Radical Aristotelianism&#39; movement, who challenged some traditional theological doctrines. Radical Aristotelianism, often associated with Averroism (<em>see the entry for Averroes in the 12^th^ century timeline</em>), was a philosophical movement in the 13th and 14th centuries that emphasised the use of reason and Aristotle&#39;s philosophy, sometimes leading to conclusions that conflicted with Christian doctrine. Key points of contention included the nature of the soul, the possibility of earthly happiness, and the eternity of the world. Some conclusions derived from Aristotelian philosophy clashed with core Christian beliefs. Aristotle&#39;s proposition of a single, universal intellect (which has ties with Indian Brahmin mystical beliefs), were regarded as contradicting the Catholic belief in the immortality of the individual human soul. The movement is also associated with the theory of &#39;double truth&#39;. This concept suggests there can be conflicting truths that result from philosophy and religious dogma, reflecting the tension between them. In today&#39;s world, this is superseded by the addition of scientific truths, creating even more intellectual tension. Despite these considerations, it had a lasting impact on Medieval and Renaissance thought; and there is an argument that its emphasis on reason and natural philosophy, led to the Enlightenment and modern, rigorous, scientific enquiry and the rise of the natural sciences.</p>
<p><strong>1285:</strong> William of Ockham (1285--1347) is born. Although William is best known largely for his contributions to logic and philosophy, he also had a significant impact on theological thought in the late Middle Ages.</p>
<p><strong>1291:</strong> The last Crusader stronghold in the Holy Land falls, marking the end of the Crusades.</p>

<p><strong>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE 14^TH^ CENTURY:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A TIMELINE OF KEY EVENTS</strong></p>
<p>The 14th century (1301-1400) was a period of significant upheaval and change across the globe. Key events include the Great Famine, the Black Death, the Hundred Years&#39; War, and various political and social shifts in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. It also marked a period of immense upheaval in the Catholic Church. The papacy&#39;s relocation to Avignon between 1309 and 1377, sometimes called the Babylonian Captivity, and which contributed to the Western Schism (1378-1417), significantly diminished the office&#39;s prestige and authority as it increasingly came under the influence of the French monarchy. Even so, the century saw a surge in reported in mystical experiences and writings, particularly in Germany and the Low Countries. The 14th century in theology was marked by significant change. The Western Schism, the decline of the Crusades, and the emergence of early reformers such as John Wycliffe began to undermine the Catholic Church and set the scene for wholesale reformation movements in subsequent centuries. However, both the controversial Dominican friar Meister Eckhart, whose writings emphasised the unknowable nature of God, excepting through personal experience, and the mystic and reformer, St Catherine of Siena, played a role in trying to maintain unity.</p>
<p>Below is a timeline highlighting some of the highlights of the period, which affected the Catholic Church and the principal theologians and popes of the day. They are and will be covered in more detail in subsequent articles and discussions.</p>
<p><strong>1305:</strong> William Wallace executed in London.</p>
<p><strong>1307:</strong> Knights Templar destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>1308:</strong> Duns Scotus (c.1265--1308) dies. A Scottish Franciscan friar and theologian, Scotus engaged in detailed philosophical and theological arguments, particularly concerning the nature of universals and the Immaculate Conception of Mary.</p>
<p><strong>1309-1376:</strong> The Avignon Papacy, with the papacy located in Avignon, France, rather than Rome. The move, cynically referred to as the Babylonian Captivity by Florentine poet Petrarch, created tension and criticism within the Church. Among the popes who resided in Avignon, subsequent Catholic historiography grants legitimacy to these:</p>
<p>Pope Clement V: 1305--1314. He moved the papal office to Avignon on 9th March, 1309. A Frenchman, Pope Clement V is remembered for suppressing the order of the Knights Templar and allowing the execution of many of its members.</p>
<p>Pope John XXII: 1316--1334. The pope is best known for centralising church administration. The Pope came into direct conflict with Franciscan Spirituals called <em>Fioretti <em>or <em>Little Flowers of St. Francis</em>,</em> who</em> made direct comparisons between Francis and his followers and Christ and his Apostles. Spiritual Franciscans also felt that the Testament of St. Francis, written by Francis on his deathbed, which prescribed poverty and mendicancy for the Franciscan order, was to be taken literally. After Francis&#39; death, the principal Franciscan Order gradually modified its rules on poverty so that the Order as a whole could possess material goods. The Spiritual Franciscans were vehemently opposed to this modification. Because of their continued criticism of the papacy and the Order, they were condemned as a heretical sect. the pope also expanded papal control over the appointment of bishops, and, against the wishes of French Emperor Louis IV, upheld papal authority over imperial elections. Pope Benedict XII: 1334--1342: Pope Benedict XII was the least convinced of the Avignon popes of the efficacy of having the papal office outside Rome. Unable relocate to the Vatican, or even Bologna (another of his preferences) he settled on enlarging and beautifying the great palace at Avignon. His bull <em>Benedictus Deus</em>, stated that souls may attain the &quot;fullness of the beatific vision&quot; before the Last Judgment. His office was in virtually constant conflict with Emperor Louis IV and he failed to bring the Holy Roman Empire back under papal dominance. He died 25 April 1342 and was buried in Avignon.</p>
<p>Pope Clement VI: 1342--1352: Roger steadfastly resisted temporal encroachments on the Church&#39;s ecclesiastical jurisdiction. and, as pope Clement VI, entrenched French dominance of the Church and opened its coffers to enhance the regal splendour of the Papacy. He recruited composers and music theorists for his court, including figures associated with the then-innovative Ars Nova style of France and the Low Countries (todays Netherlands and northern Belgium).</p>
<p>Pope Innocent VI: 1352--1362: Another French pope. He majored in civil law at the University of Toulouse and later took holy orders, rising to become a bishop in 1338. He appointed as a cardinal four years later by Pope Clement VI, who he followed as pope. Pope Innocent was a reformer, encouraging bishops and cardinals to actually live in their sees, and tried to reform the papal curia. Like his predecessors, he railed against the growing power of the French monarchy, which was still in control of the Holy Roman Empire. He forgave and released the Roman tribune Cola di Rienzo, who had been excommunicated by Clement for heresy because of his rebellion against the Holy Roman Empire. The pope encouraged Rienzo in 1353 to assist Cardinal Albornoz, vicar general of the Papal States, in restoring papal power at Rome, hoping to make possible a return of the papacy from Avignon to Rome. Rienzo, however, was killed on October 8th, 1354, in a Roman riot, and Innocent died before he could fulfill his dream of returning to Rome.</p>
<p>Pope Urban V: 1362--1370: (in Rome 1367--1370; returned to Avignon 1370).  Pope Urban V was a member of the Order of Saint Benedict and is the only Avignon pope to be beatified. He was known for his efforts to restore peace within the Church. He was elected pope in 1362 while on diplomatic business, even though he was not a cardinal. His reign was blessed by his peacekeeping activity between the French and Italian kings, the founding of many universities, his zeal for the crusades and his decision to return the papacy to Rome and end the Avignon exile of the popes. However, the breakout of war between England and France forced him to return to Avignon on a peacekeeping mission, whereupon he died. He was buried in Marseille and his tomb reportedly became the site of miracles. Pious, Pope Urban lived simply, retained his Benedictine habit and was renowned for his virtue, unusual in a church and a political system that was corrupt and scandal-riven.</p>
<p>Pope Gregory XI: 1370--1378: The last of the official popes in Avignon. Persuaded by Catherine of Siena, he left Avignon to return to Rome on 13 September 1376. He was the nephew of Pope Clement VI. Gregory XI did not survive much longer after his move to Rome. He died on 27 March 1378 aged about 48. Pope Urban VI, an Italian, was elected to the papacy after his death. However, Pope Gregory XI&#39;s decision to move the papacy back to Rome ultimately led to the Western Schism and the rise of the so-called Antipopes. Most of Europe supported Clement VII (now considered an antipope) as the true pope. Subsequently, the Western Schism created by the selection of rival popes forced Europe into a dilemma of papal allegiance for the next thirty years, until the Church achieved unity once more following the Council of Constance, convened between 1414 and 1418 and the election of Pope Martin V.</p>
<p><strong>1314:</strong> Battle of Bannockburn: Scottish victory in the First War of Scottish Independence.</p>
<p><strong>1315-1317:</strong> The Great Famine, a period of widespread crop failure and starvation.</p>
<p><strong>1328:</strong> End of the First War of Scottish Independence.</p>
<p><strong>1328:</strong> Meister Eckhart (c.1260--1328) dies. A German Dominican friar and mystic, Eckhart&#39;s writings explored themes of union with God and the nature of the divine ground. His teachings, while influential, also sparked controversy and were later condemned by the Church. However, in recent years, he has enjoyed something of a rehabilitation, with Popes in the later part of the 20^th^ century, repeatedly referring to his work, while the Dominican order has done much to rehabilitate his theological works.</p>
<p><strong>1337:</strong> The Hundred Years&#39; War begins, a conflict between England and France over territorial claims and the French throne.</p>
<p><strong>1346</strong>: Battle of Crécy, an early English victory in the Hundred Years&#39; War.</p>
<p><strong>1347:</strong> William of Ockham (c.1287--1347) dies. A pivotal figure in late medieval philosophy and theology, Ockham is best known for <em>Ockham&#39;s Razor</em> (nowadays more commonly referred to as <em>Occam&#39;s Razor),</em> the principle of parsimony, which suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the best. His nominalist philosophy challenged the prevailing Aristotelian realism and influenced subsequent theological and philosophical thought.</p>
<p><strong>1347-1351:</strong> The Black Death, a devastating pandemic of bubonic plague, begins to spread across Europe. The plague ravaged Europe, leading to widespread death and societal disruption. This event significantly impacted religious thought, with some interpreting it as divine punishment and others questioning the Church&#39;s ability to offer solace and protection.  The second pandemic of the Black Death, which was particularly deadly.</p>
<p><strong>1348:</strong> University of Prague founded.</p>
<p><strong>1348-1350:</strong> Peak of the Black Death in Europe, killing an estimated 30-60% of the population.</p>
<p><strong>1358:</strong> The Italian Augustinian friar Gregory of Rimini (c. 1300-1358) dies. Gregory is known for his work on grace, free will, and the sacraments. He emphasised the importance of divine grace in salvation and challenged some of the prevailing views on human nature.</p>
<p><strong>1378-1417:</strong> The Western Schism, where multiple individuals claimed to be the legitimate Pope, further weakening the authority of the papacy and causing division within the Church. The two Avignon-based antipopes were:</p>
<p>Clement VII: 1378--1394. Pope Clement VII was almost universally acknowledged as the true pope, however, politics ensured he would not rule from the Vatican and modern history casts him in the mould of antipope.</p>
<p>Benedict XIII: 1394--1423 (expelled from Avignon in 1403)</p>
<p>Benedict XIII was succeeded by three antipopes, who had little or no public following, and were not resident at Avignon:</p>
<p>Clement VIII: 1423--1429 recognized by the Crown of Aragon; abdicated</p>
<p>Benedict XIV: 1424--1429 or 1430</p>
<p>Benedict XIV: 1430?--1437</p>
<p>Parties within the Catholic Church were divided in their allegiance among the various claimants to the office of pope. The Council of Constance finally resolved the controversy in 1417 when the election of Pope Martin V was accepted by all Catholic bishops.</p>
<p><strong>1380:</strong> Caterina di Jacopo di Benincasa (1347-- 1380), known as St Catherine of Siena dies. One of the patron saints of Italy, and recognised as a doctor of the church. Caterina Jacopo di Benincasa, the daughter of a wealthy cloth dyer, was born and raised in Siena, The house where Catherine grew up still exists. Catherine wanted from an early age to devote herself to God, against the will of her parents. She joined the <em>mantellates</em>, a group of pious women, primarily widows, informally devoted to Dominican spirituality. Energetic, clever and erudite, Caterina enjoyed influence with Pope Gregory XI and reportedly played a role in his 1376 decision to leave Avignon and re-establish the papal office in the Vatican.  The Pope then sent Catherine to negotiate peace with the Florentine Republic. After Pope Gregory XI&#39;s death in March 1378 and the conclusion of peace with Florence in the same year, Caterina returned to Siena. She dictated to secretaries her set of spiritual treatises, <em>The Dialogue of Divine Providence</em>. However, her life of seclusion was short-lived. The Great Schism of the West, which fractured the office of the papacy for almost nigh on 30 years, forced Caterina&#39;s return to Rome. From her office there, she sent numerous letters to princes and cardinals to promote obedience to Pope Urban VI and to defend what she called the &quot;vessel of the Church&quot;. She died at the end of April 1380, exhausted by her rigorous fasting and overwork. Catherine of Siena was canonised in 1461 by Pope Pius II.</p>
<p><strong>1381:</strong> The Peasants&#39; Revolt in England was a significant social uprising, partly fired by religious grievances and discontent with the Church and social hierarchy. It also challenged</p>
<p>taxation and feudal restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>1381:</strong> John of Ruysbroeck (1293-1381) dies. A Flemish mystic, Ruysbroeck focused on the contemplative life and the ascent to union with God. His writings emphasized the importance of both active and contemplative spiritual practices.</p>
<p><strong>1384:</strong> Death of John Wycliffe, an English theologian and early Church reformer. Wycliffe&#39;s views on scripture, sacraments, and papal authority anticipated some of the ideas that would later be central to the Protestant Reformation. He also spurred the rise of Lollardy, a popular heresy in England influenced by Wycliffe&#39;s teachings, challenging the Church&#39;s doctrines and practices.</p>`,

    title: "Saint Rafqa",
    description: "Some people suffer and suffering defeats them. Others? Well, they rise above it. Nelson Mandela, in a letter to his wife Winnie from Kroonstad Prison in 1975 wrote: \"\\\"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\\\" Saint Rafqa (sometimes called Saint Rebecca) is the epitome of Mandela's quote; someone who, in the face of seeming insurmountable odds, just kept on trying. Not only that, but she also called suffering upon herself, in order to be closer to God and honour the Passion of the Christ.\n",
    content: `<p><img src="media/image1.png" alt="A statue of a nun AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>
<p>Rafqa Pietra Chobok (1832-1914)  was a Lebanese Maronite nun, renowned for her deep devotion to God, and her unwavering faith in the face of adversity and personal suffering. She endured blindness, paralysis, and intense pain, which in faith, she offered as a sacrifice to God and is revered for her particular brand of piety. A growing number of miracles are attributed to her intercession. Santa Rafqa was canonised by Pope St John Paul II in June 2001 and is the patron saint of lost parents and the sick.</p>
<p><strong>A life of service</strong></p>
<p>Rafqa was born in Himlaya, a Lebanese village located in the Matn District in Mount Lebanon, on June 29, 1832, the only child of Saber Mourad El Rayess and Rafqa Gemaye, and was given the name Boutrossieh. Her mother died when she was seven and at the age of nine, she was sent to work as a servant for four years in Damascus, when her father fell on hard times. She returned home in 1847 to find that her father had remarried.</p>
<p>When Boutrossieh was 14 years old, her stepmother pressured her to marry her brother, while her maternal aunt wanted her to marry her son. Boutrossieh had no interest in either, which caused discord in her family. Asking God to help her, she opted to become a nun, leaving home unannounced, to the Convent of Our Lady of Liberation at Bikfaya. Her family tried to persuade her to return home. She strenuously objected to returning, leaving her family to leave empty handed, and she never saw them again.</p>
<p>Some years later a relative, Joseph Gemayel, founded a religious institute for women that offered them a full time education and religious teaching. Boutrossieh was among the first candidates, known as the Daughters of Mary of the Immaculate Conception (shortened to the Mariamette Sisters), to join. She was 21.</p>
<p>In 1860 she was sent to the Jesuit mission at Deir-el-Qamar, in Mount Lebanon. It was a testing assignment. A local conflict over land rights between Druze landowners and Maronite farmers, coupled with resentment of Ottoman land reforms and growing European influence in the country, created a volatile environment, which ignited the conflict into civil war. In less than two months the Druze killed over 7500 people, destroying some 360 villages, 560 churches, 28 schools, and 42 convents. Sister Rafqa, deeply affected by the massacres, managed to save a child&#39;s live, hiding him from soldiers in the skirts of her habit. She received the habit of her congregation the following year and took her first, temporary vows in 1862, taking the name Rafqa. Sent to a Jesuit school in Ghazir, she stayed for several years, teaching religious instruction to workers in a local cotton mill, and studied Arabic, calligraphy and mathematics.</p>
<p>In 1871, when the Mariamette Sisters merged with another institution to form the Order of the Sacred Hearts of Mary and Jesus, Sister Boutrossieh opted instead to join the monastic Baladita Order, after a dream in which, among others Saint George encouraged her to serve as a cloistered nun. The same year she joined the Monastery of St. Simon in Al-Qarn, where she took her final vows and took the name Rafqa, remaining in the monastery until 1897.</p>
<p>Some years earlier, in 1885, Sister Rafqa began to lose her sight, which she offered up in selfless sacrifice to God. following a botched operation to restore her sight, she lost an eye and suffered intense headaches, which she offered up in commemoration of the Passion of Christ. Nevertheless, she remained an active member of her community, spinning wool and cotton, knitting and of course, prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Monastery of St. Joseph</strong></p>
<p>In 1897, the Lebanese Maronite Order constructed a new monastery dedicated to St. Joseph at al Dahr in Jrabta, Batroun province. Rafqa was one of six nuns, led by Mother Ursula Doumit, who were sent there to set up a working convent. By 1899 she was completely blind and paralysed. By now confined to bed, Sister Rafqa used her time to knit socks. Near the end of her life, she was asked by Sister Ursula if she would like to see; Rafqa prayed to be able to see for an hour, and reportedly this prayer was answered. Sister Rafqa dies on March 23^rd^, 1914.</p>
<p>On March 23, 1914, she died. Her body was buried in the monastery cemetery and was later transferred to the monastery chapel.</p>
<p><strong>Beatification and canonization</strong></p>
<p>On June 9, 1984, on the vigil of Pentecost, Pope Saint John Paul II, approved the miracle of Elizabeth Ennakl, who was said to have been completely cured of uterine cancer in 1938 at the tomb of Sister Rafqa. In November 1985, the pope declared Sister Rafqa as a Blessed, and on June 10, 2001, he proclaimed her sainthood.  Her feast day is celebrated on March 23rd.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Sister Rafqa prayed to share in the sufferings of Christ, and her prayer was answered with severe headaches, blindness, and paralysis.  She endured these afflictions for many years, experiencing intense pain and physical deterioration, and she embraced these trials with joy and patience. Her story is an inspiration to those who suffer, demonstrating the power of faith and love in the face of adversity.</p>`,

    title: "Julian Of Norwich Theologian",
    intro: "There's much we don't know about Julian of Norwich: her real name, when and where she was born and when she died. Even so, her legacy has spanned centuries. Julian is best known to us through her profound visions, leading her to write the influential *Revelations of Divine Love*, which contain unusually modern views.\n",

<p>Julian of Norwich is perhaps best known to us as a 14th-century English mystic, writer, and anchoress who experienced profound visions in 1373, leading her to write the influential <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em>, in both a long and short form, which contain unusually modern views on the nature of God and his unconditional love for humanity.</p>
<p>Following a series of visions of Jesus, in her late thirties, Julian of Norwich (c 1342- after 1416) opted to become an anchoress. In medieval times, an anchoress was a religious woman who, after receiving permission from a bishop, became permanently walled into a small cell (anchorhold), usually attached to a church. Anchoresses, as they came to be known, voluntarily chose a solitary life of prayer and contemplation, rather than joining a formal religious order. Even so, being holed up in a small cell for the rest of one&#39;s life, was considered a profound commitment to God. As such anchorites answered only to a local bishop, and not to any other ecclesiastical superior.</p>
<p>While anchorites were considered dead to the material world (in some instances choosing a rite of consecration that resembled the Office for the Dead at their initiation) they nonetheless interacted regularly with visitors, and became popular as spiritual advisors. A noted visitor to Julian was the medieval mystic Margery Kempe (1373 -- after 1438). Margery is the author of the earliest surviving autobiography, written in Middle English (we understand it as the language of Chaucer, for instance). In <em>The Book of Margery Kempe</em> she describes meeting with Julian, after being asked by Christ to visit her. Margery &quot;told her about the grace, that God had put into her soul, of compunction, contrition, sweetness and devotion [...] and also many wonderful revelations, which she described to the anchoress to find out if there were any deception in them, for the anchoress was expert in such things and could give good advice*.&quot;*</p>
<p>Yet, to make this clearly restricted life work, a complex set of rules was attached, laid out in texts such as the <em>Ancrene Wisse</em>, which provided detailed guidance on all aspects of an anchorite&#39;s life. This included the work detail of servants allotted to them, who brought necessities and helped with their toilet. Guidance also covered spiritual discipline, daily routines and permissions regarding personal possessions and pets. Some anchoresses, such as Julian of Norwich, were considered living saints.</p>
<p>She became attached to St Julian&#39;s Church in Norwich, from which she took her name. Julian had opted to follow the life of an anchoress after a life-threatening illness, at the age of 30, during which Julian had a series of sixteen visions, or &quot;shewings&quot; as they were called at the time. These visions appear to have transformed her life, revealing aspects of God&#39;s love and grace. Julian devoted her life to interpreting the meaning of her visions. She accounts of her experiences, in a work called <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em> (or <em>Showings</em>, as it is sometimes called), which is now considered one of the most important works of medieval Christian mysticism and was the first book written by a woman in English.</p>
<p>Her text contains two parts: the <em>Short Text</em>, thought to have been written shortly after her near-fatal illness in 1373, and the <em>Long Text</em> completed some twenty years later. As the title suggests, it analyses and expands upon her original work. Even so, her ideas were radical at the time, putting a spin on her understanding of God that contrasted with rather austere church teaching of the day. Julian believed in a supportive God</p>
<p>Although uncoordinated somewhat with her theological contemporaries, she became extremely popular. Her seclusion, if you can call it that, coincided with immense social and religious turmoil. The Black Death (1347-1353) and the Peasants Revolt (1381) were key points in her lifetime and would have unnerved the people of Norwich sufficiently to seek spiritual guidance and a better understanding perhaps of the tumult around them. While the Black Death (1346 -- 1353) significantly impacted Norwich, it also created opportunities for social mobility, and immigration from the countryside helped restore its population and boost the textile industry. By the time Julian assumed residence at St Julian&#39;s, some twenty years later, a substantial cadre of rich traders and merchants regularly attended services at the church, visiting Julian no doubt a feature of their devotions, though memories of rebuilding their lives after the plague, would not have been forgotten.</p>
<p>The Black Death denuded the population of England by about a third, and it had a tremendously adverse effect on both the economy and the wellbeing of people. Many communities were denuded and survivors would have suffered from some form of long term stress disorder, similar to what we understand today as PTSD. How it affected Julian, we do not know.</p>
<p>Even if the worst of the plague had passed her by, she would have been well aware of the growing discontent among the English population in the 1380s. The Peasants&#39; Revolt was a widespread uprising against the teenage King Richard II and the ruling elite in England, sparked in the main by new taxes, low wages, and inadequate protections against exploitation by feudal lords and landlords. It was led by more than one person. Among them was Wat Tyler and John Ball, a member of the so-called Lollards. John Ball was a Lollard priest, whose sermons focused on the need for equality under the law and criticism of the extreme wealth and exploitative actions of Barons and landowners. The rebels, coming from all parts of southeast England, but mainly Essex, marched on London, destroying buildings and beheading officials, even Simon Sudbury, the then Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor. The 14 year old King Richard II met with the rebels at first at Blackheath and then at Smithfield, where Wat Tyler was stabbed. The king initially promised concessions, but soon reneged on them and had the rebels severely punished.</p>
<p>Julian was never then entirely out of the zeitgeist. Norwich in the 13^th^ and 14^th^ centuries was the second largest city in England and a hub of political activity and power. A striking symbol of Norman power, the city was a stronghold, with an extensive system of defensive city walls and gates. Norwich was a thriving centre of trade and industry. Its strategic location on the River Wensum, rich agricultural hinterland, and strong ties with the Low Countries fuelled a booming textile industry and attracted immigrants who further boosted its economy. The city&#39;s affluence is evidenced by its large number of medieval buildings. It was also a kind of religious centre, not as important as say Canterbury, but it was famous for having more churches than any other city north of the Alps. Even today, it has a large number of surviving medieval religious buildings, including the impressive Norwich Cathedral. And although all traces of Julian of Norwich&#39;s cell have disappeared, a modern chapel at St Julian&#39;s Church is dedicated to her memory, and she is honoured in the city with an unofficial feast day on May 13th.</p>
<p>Julian&#39;s writings explore complex theological themes of God&#39;s love, suffering, and redemption, with the famous assertion, &quot;All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well&quot;. Unlike the Latin-dominated scholarly works of the time, many female mystics wrote in their vernacular languages, making their mystical teachings more accessible. Julian of Norwich was no exception. Although a contemporary of the English poets Geoffrey Chaucer and William Langland, Julian was, by her own account, <em>unlettered.</em> In other words, uneducated and could not read or write in Latin. Nonetheless, she was taught in Middle English, the language of the common man. And while she did not have access to the growing library of religious tomes in the city, and cognisant of the disparity between rich and poor in the city and the incidence of intermittent plagues and sickness, her writings are nevertheless suffused with hope and trust in God&#39;s goodness. While her vision begins with Jesus&#39; crucifixion, she did not remain weeping at the foot of the cross over Christ&#39;s pains and her own in the usual late medieval style, but found in the crucifixion a comforting vision of Christ&#39;s redeeming love.</p>
<p><em>Revelations</em> spans the most profound mysteries of the Christian faith---such as the question of predestination; the foreknowledge of God; and the existence of evil. She insisted that &quot;Our Lord wants us to know&quot; about God&#39;s unconditional love, mercy, and grace; about the godly will at the very core of our being; about the lack of &quot;wrath or blame&quot; in God. These are themes that are often picked up in modern day theology. Interestingly, a prominent aspect of Julian&#39;s writing is her descrip­tion of God as Mother: &quot;As truly as God is our Father, so truly is God our Mother,&quot; underscoring her conviction of God&#39;s unconditional love of humanity. &quot;I understand three ways of contemplating motherhood in God. The first is the foundation of our nature&#39;s creation; the second is his taking of our nature, where the motherhood of grace begins; the third is the motherhood at work . . . and it is all one love.&quot;</p>
<p>This aspect of her work would not have set her apart in the Middle Ages. Medieval spiritual writers most often asso­ciated feminine imagery with the second person of the Trinity, identified with Holy Wisdom (Sophia), a trait specifically attached to the person of Jesus at the time. What separates Julian is that she attaches the feminine (Wisdom) to all members of the Holy Trinity, rather than just Jesus. &quot;...the deep wisdom of the Trinity is our Mother, and the great love of the Trinity is our Lord&quot;.</p>
<p>Though unorthodox in her day, Julian is heralded by modern day religious commentators as offering clarity of vision and precision in her theological presentation. She writes with a mix of warm sympathy, tempered with realism of the vagaries of life. As she noted in Chapter 68: <em>He [Christ] did not say, &#39;You shall not be perturbed, you shall not be troubled, you shall not be distressed&#39;, but he said, &#39;You shall not be overcome.&#39;&quot;</em></p>
<p>Her importance is underlined by the fact that she was one of a rare cadre of female mystics spanning more than 200 years of the Middle Ages. It&#39;s a roll of honour that includes figures such as the abbess Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), who wrote almost two hundred years before Julian, but who was also renowned for her visions of the divine and her writings. Then there is St Catherine of Siena, (1347--1380) was an Italian mystic, a contemporary of Julian. However, St Catherine was an activist, and Doctor of the Church, known for her deep faith, extensive writings, and political influence, particularly in bringing the papacy back to Rome. Her life was marked by a strong devotion to the Eucharist, and a commitment to serving the poor and sick, as well as being a respected diplomat.</p>
<p>Then there is the tragic Marguerite Porete (1250-1310) called a Beguine because she was a member of the Beguine movement, a group of laywomen in the Middle Ages who lived lives of spiritual devotion and performed acts of charity without taking formal religious vows or joining a formal religious order. She likely lived as an itinerant Beguine, dedicating herself to mystical contemplation and writing spiritual texts in the vernacular, eventually leading to her condemnation and execution for heresy by ecclesiastical authorities. Mechthild of Magdeburg (1207-1282), was another Beguine who wrote about divine love in the vernacular. These women, often from various social strata, gained spiritual authority through their profound experiences and writings, though their visions sometimes required validation by male clergy. Although they were spiritual authorities, these women mystics often relied on male figures in the Church---such as priests or confessors---to help record and validate their experiences, especially if they were illiterate. Many women experienced divine visions, with some, like Hildegard, having these experiences from a young age, but because Beguines refused to commit to a religious order, their lives were at times difficult and at odds with religious clergy.</p>
<p>Julian is thought to have died around 1416 and while her original manuscript has been lost, thanks to the work of 20^th^ century translator Grace Warrack, her writings remain accessible. Today, only seventeenth century copies of earlier manuscripts of the long text, and fragments from the fifteenth century survive.</p>
<p>Equally, virtually nothing is left of the original cell where Julian lived and prayed, authored her book, and ministered to those who came to her window. In the 1950s the cell was reconstructed, along with the church which had been destroyed during WWII bombardment. The reconstructed cell serves as the Julian Shrine, a place of pilgrimage and prayer. Next door to the church the Julian Centre, run by the Friends of Julian, offers hospitality, a library, and a bookshop, and the All Hallows Guesthouse ministers to pilgrims..</p>

    title: "Julian Of Norwich",
    intro: "There's much we don't know about Julian of Norwich: her real name, when and where she was born and when she died. Even so, her legacy has spanned centuries. Julian is best known to us through her profound visions, leading her to write the influential *Revelations of Divine Love*, which contain unusually modern views.\n",

<p>Julian of Norwich is perhaps best known to us as a 14th-century English mystic, writer, and anchoress who experienced profound visions in 1373, leading her to write the influential <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em>, in both a long and short form, which contain unusually modern views on the nature of God and his unconditional love for humanity.</p>
<p>Following a series of visions of Jesus, in her late thirties, Julian of Norwich (c 1342- after 1416) opted to become an anchoress. In medieval times, an anchoress was a religious woman who, after receiving permission from a bishop, became permanently walled into a small cell (anchorhold), usually attached to a church. Anchoresses, as they came to be known, voluntarily chose a solitary life of prayer and contemplation, rather than joining a formal religious order. Even so, being holed up in a small cell for the rest of one&#39;s life, was considered a profound commitment to God. As such anchorites answered only to a local bishop, and not to any other ecclesiastical superior.</p>
<p>While anchorites were considered dead to the material world (in some instances choosing a rite of consecration that resembled the Office for the Dead at their initiation) they nonetheless interacted regularly with visitors, and became popular as spiritual advisors. A noted visitor to Julian was the medieval mystic Margery Kempe (1373 -- after 1438). Margery is the author of the earliest surviving autobiography, written in Middle English (we understand it as the language of Chaucer, for instance). In <em>The Book of Margery Kempe</em> she describes meeting with Julian, after being asked by Christ to visit her. Margery &quot;told her about the grace, that God had put into her soul, of compunction, contrition, sweetness and devotion [...] and also many wonderful revelations, which she described to the anchoress to find out if there were any deception in them, for the anchoress was expert in such things and could give good advice*.&quot;*</p>
<p>Yet, to make this clearly restricted life work, a complex set of rules was attached, laid out in texts such as the <em>Ancrene Wisse</em>, which provided detailed guidance on all aspects of an anchorite&#39;s life. This included the work detail of servants allotted to them, who brought necessities and helped with their toilet. Guidance also covered spiritual discipline, daily routines and permissions regarding personal possessions and pets. Some anchoresses, such as Julian of Norwich, were considered living saints.</p>
<p>She became attached to St Julian&#39;s Church in Norwich, from which she took her name. Julian had opted to follow the life of an anchoress after a life-threatening illness, at the age of 30, during which Julian had a series of sixteen visions, or &quot;shewings&quot; as they were called at the time. These visions appear to have transformed her life, revealing aspects of God&#39;s love and grace. Julian devoted her life to interpreting the meaning of her visions. She accounts of her experiences, in a work called <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em> (or <em>Showings</em>, as it is sometimes called), which is now considered one of the most important works of medieval Christian mysticism and was the first book written by a woman in English.</p>
<p>Her text contains two parts: the <em>Short Text</em>, thought to have been written shortly after her near-fatal illness in 1373, and the <em>Long Text</em> completed some twenty years later. As the title suggests, it analyses and expands upon her original work. Even so, her ideas were radical at the time, putting a spin on her understanding of God that contrasted with rather austere church teaching of the day. Julian believed in a supportive God</p>
<p>Although uncoordinated somewhat with her theological contemporaries, she became extremely popular. Her seclusion, if you can call it that, coincided with immense social and religious turmoil. The Black Death (1347-1353) and the Peasants Revolt (1381) were key points in her lifetime and would have unnerved the people of Norwich sufficiently to seek spiritual guidance and a better understanding perhaps of the tumult around them. While the Black Death (1346 -- 1353) significantly impacted Norwich, it also created opportunities for social mobility, and immigration from the countryside helped restore its population and boost the textile industry. By the time Julian assumed residence at St Julian&#39;s, some twenty years later, a substantial cadre of rich traders and merchants regularly attended services at the church, visiting Julian no doubt a feature of their devotions, though memories of rebuilding their lives after the plague, would not have been forgotten.</p>
<p>The Black Death denuded the population of England by about a third, and it had a tremendously adverse effect on both the economy and the wellbeing of people. Many communities were denuded and survivors would have suffered from some form of long term stress disorder, similar to what we understand today as PTSD. How it affected Julian, we do not know.</p>

    title: "Peter Abelard",
    intro: "Peter Abelard (1079--21 April 1142) came to prominence as a philosopher, poet, musician, and theologian. But it came at great cost. Abelard's systematic and audacious treatment of religious doctrines are noted for their understanding, subtlety, and intellectual brilliance. His affair with Héloïse made him a tragic figure of romance and, across time, it is this and not his contribution to theology, the main reason for his fame.",

<p>Much of Abelard&#39;s life is chronicled in his writing and for all his brilliance, his tendency towards self-indulgence and feelings that the world did not understand his genius, contributed to much of his suffering. He championed the use of reason in matters of faith and was among the first to use &#39;theology&#39; in its modern sense, alongside his contemporary Peter Lombard. The world doesn&#39;t always like or appreciate genius. Many people of outstanding intellect suffer immensely. The fates of Alan Turing and Hypatia of Alexandria, despite their accomplishments, show that not much has changed over the centuries in this regard.</p>
<p>The quality of Abelard, is that while opposition to much of his writings resulted in harassment and humiliation by leading figures in the Catholic Church, is that his intellectual heft helped him rise above much of it. And it is to his credit that he stood on his principles, sometimes at great cost.</p>
<p>We know quite a bit about Peter Abelard, because much of his world view and his responses to the challenges that faced him are outlined in his long autobiographical letter <em>Historia calamitatum</em>. It literally translates as &#39;The story of my troubles&#39;. His poignant correspondence with the equally tragic Héloïse, the love of his life and mother of his son, tell us much about his character.</p>
<h2>Abelard&#39;s early life. {#abelards-early-life}</h2>
<p>Abelard was born some time between 1078 and 1080 in the small town of Le Pallet, near Nantes, in Brittany, where his noble family carried weight. As a consequence of his family&#39;s wealth, he was well educated, particularly in the Classics and he was clearly a bright student. His early introduction to Greek and Roman writers and historians was later reflected in the familiarity with which he harnessed some of their ideas and philosophy into his own.</p>
<p>Equally, like other notable people of the Medieval period (I&#39;m thinking of St Francis of Assisi, St Catherine of Siena, and others) Abelard cast off his prosperous backstory to serve God and his massive intellect through teaching and the formulation of new critical approaches to the study of theology. Like many of his contemporary Medieval luminaries, Abelard renounced his inheritance to study philosophy under tutors such as Roscelin and William of Champeaux.</p>
<h2>Abelard&#39;s early influencers {#abelards-early-influencers}</h2>
<p>Roscelin of Compiegne (1050- 1125), was an early tutor of Abelard, teaching both philosopher and theology. Roscelin had studied at both Soissons and Rheinis. In 1098 he became a canon at Compiegne and taught there and at Besancon. Styled by his contemporaries as <em>Novi Lyaei Conditor</em> (essential founder of new schools or teaching), he is regarded by historians as an early originator of the critical school of nominalism, in the study of universals. In the medieval world, universals referred to abstract concepts or general terms that apply to multiple individual things. They were a central topic of debate, exploring whether these universals had an independent reality or were simply mental constructs.</p>
<p>Universals denoted, argued medieval scholars, either real, existing things beyond individual instances and experience, or they were simply labels used to categorise and understand the world, depending on which side you were on. The debate grappled with, for instance, whether properties such as &quot;roundness&quot; exist independently of the things that are round, and if so, how?</p>
<p>An often quoted simile that helps describe this tension is our encounter with, for example, multiple instances of &quot;redness,&quot;. Do we understand the concept of redness outside of things we understand as red, such as a red pillar box? Do our minds form a concept of &quot;redness&quot; solely based on our experiences of seeing items that are red (a pillarbox, or lipstick). Or do we understand the colour red outside our immediate experience of it? And if we understand it outside of our experience, what do we base our understanding on?</p>
<p>In Abelard&#39;s day there was little consensus on the understanding of universals. In fact, it vexed philosophers for centuries. Why was it important? Because the study of universals involves important questions about the nature of perception, existence, location, and the means of understanding these properties.</p>
<p>It certainly vexed Aristotle and Plato, who took different approaches to the question and their arguments were regularly resurrected in medieval halls of academia. Plato took the view that universals exist as eternal, unchanging forms, separate from the physical world and that particular objects participate in or resemble these forms. For example, there&#39;s a perfect, ideal form of &quot;redness&quot; that all red things in the world merely imitate. Aristotle, on the other hand argued that universals exist in the particulars, and not separately. Redness, for instance, exists within each individual red object. There isn&#39;t a separate form of redness that they all share.</p>
<p>If all this seems pedantic, remember that modern philosophy was still in its embryonic form. Moreover, it was a time in history when leading thinkers such as St Thomas Aquinas would drill down ideas to infinitesimal proportions. Aquinas proposed, for instance, calculations for determining the number of angels that could dance on a pinhead!</p>
<p>We have no extant treatise of Compiegne to determine exactly what his position was, other than a letter to Peter Abelard, who studied under him at Besancon. Roscelin&#39;s nominalism stuck with Abelard, who later refined his own approach to universals, which came to be called Conceptualism. More of that later. We understand from that letter that Roscelin understood universals to be no more than verbal expressions. Roscelin died about 1100.</p>
<p>William of Champeaux (1070-1122) meanwhile taught at the Cathedral School of Notre Dame in Paris and was a proponent of the scholastic approach to universals. This involved reaching a conclusion by juxtaposing two opposing views. Abelard would both compete with and regularly return to hear Williams teaching on universals and adopted William&#39;s dialectic approach in many of his works, in particular <em>Sic et Non</em>.</p>
<h2>Abelard and Conceptualism {#abelard-and-conceptualism}</h2>
<p>What Abelard did was lay out the problem of understanding universals as abstract concepts with no corresponding reality. It was initially a nominalist approach and one that carried weight well into the 12^th^ century. The philosopher William of Ockham (of Occam&#39;s&#39; Razor) developed nominalism substantially. However, Abelard looked for a way to merge opposing opinions. He began to think that universals exist only as concepts in our minds (Conceptualism), which was a middle way. Clearly building on the nominalist position of William of Champeaux, Abelard&#39;s point was that universals are not simply names (like nominalism) nor independent entities (like realism). He argued that universal concepts are formed through abstraction from individual, experienced things.</p>
<p>Abelard&#39;s conceptualism significantly shaped the medieval philosophical debate on universals and continues to be relevant in discussions today about the nature of concepts and knowledge.</p>
<p>By 1104 Abelard felt confident enough to set himself up as a lecturer, first at Melun and then at Corbeil. In the early 12^th^ century, centres of learning competed with each other to attract students by dint of the reputation of their leading tutors. Abelard competed mainly with his previous tutor William of Champeaux for students and reputation.</p>
<p>The strain of intellectual competition however proved too much---Abelard&#39;s health failed, and he returned to Brittany for several years. Abelard returned to Paris sometime between 1108 and 1113 with his health restored. He even attended William of Champeaux&#39;s lectures, and argued with him William over the problem of universals. According to Abelard&#39;s rather self-satisfied report, he bested his teacher in debate, and gained his reputation as a dialectician of note, teaching at several schools.</p>
<p>Around 1113 Abelard decided to study theology; he sought out the most eminent teacher of theology of his day, Anselm of Laon, and became his student. In the event, Anselm&#39;s traditional methods were antithetical to Abelard, who eventually returned to Notre Dame to continue on his own. It would be the last time he studied with anyone.</p>
<p>At Notre Dame he became entangled with Héloïse, which led to his castration [<em>we are not going to cover this here, there are references at the end if you want to follow up this part of Abelard&#39;s life</em>]. He then entered the Benedictine monastery of Saint Denis to recover, after which he began teaching at a local priory and it is there that he developed his theology of the Trinity.</p>
<p>From this point on, Abelard&#39;s audacious approach to theology and philosophy caused him to drift inexorably into regular conflict with the church and its leaders. His method of philosophical analysis was seen as a direct challenge to more traditional approaches. The reaction to his work became so strong that a special synod was convened in Soissons in 1121, to examine Abelard&#39;s writing.</p>
<p>The bishops particularly objected to his book <em>Theologia,</em> which they condemned as heretical and it was publicly burned. The bishops argued that dialectical reasoning (in other words, logic) in discussing the Trinity was inappropriate and potentially led to heretical interpretations. They required intellectually arrogant Abelard to make a public avowal of faith, which invariably was meant to humble him. He was also forced into effective exile in an area of difficult terrain to devote himself to quiet contemplation.</p>
<p>His period of exile didn&#39;t last long as Abelard himself said that poverty forced him to resume teaching. Together with a coterie of students, who were attracted to his then innovative approach to study, he constructed an oratory that they called the Paraclete, where he continued to write, teach, and research.</p>
<p>In 1126, Abelard accepted an invitation to become abbot of the monastery of Saint Gildas de Rhuys in Brittany. He donated the Paraclete to the convent of Argenteuil, where Héloïse had retired to after the birth of their son Astrolabe. However, Abelard found the monks of Saint Gildas difficult and obstructive. It is here that he wrote one of his masterworks, <em>Historia calamitatum,</em> where he claimed there were a number of attempts on his life.</p>
<p>By the mid-1130s Abelard was given permission to return to Paris to teach, albeit retaining his title as abbot. Now his work came to attention of Bernard of Clairvaux, who objected to some of Abelard&#39;s conclusions as well as to his approach to matters of faith. Their tussle over approaches to faith lasted years, despite some attempts to resolve their differences of opinion. Finally, in 1140 Abelard asked the Archbishop of Sens to arrange a public debate between Bernard and himself. Bernard eventually agreed, but in the interim arranged to convene another commission of enquiry to review Abelard&#39;s treatises.</p>
<p>Abelard was horrified to find there was somewhat of a fixed jury, rather than an objective debating forum. He withdrew, announcing he would travel to Rome to appeal to the Pope over his mistreatment. Meanwhile, the commission condemned nineteen propositions it claimed to find in his works and adjourned. Bernard also scuppered Abelard&#39;s appeal to the Pope and a letter from Pope Innocent II upheld the decision of the Council of Soisson while Abelard was a Cluny. The letter ordered him to silence and reconciliation with Bernard, to which Abelard complied.</p>
<p>Peter the Venerable, the abbot of Cluny, wrote to the Pope about the reconciliation between Abelard and Bernard, and the Pope lifted Abelard&#39;s sentence. Abelard remained under the protection of Peter the Venerable first at Cluny, then at St. Marcel, but after so much tumult in his life, Abelard&#39;s his health began to deteriorate. Abelard died on 21 April 1142. His body was interred at the Paraclete, and today is (with Héloïse) buried in Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris.</p>
<h2>Abelard&#39;s Works {#abelards-works}</h2>
<p>Abelard was a prolific writer for his time and wrote across a number of categories, including logic, dialectics, theology, the philosophy of language, and metaphysics. His two masterworks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Logica</em> &#39;<em>ingredientibus</em>&#39;,</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Dialectica</em>,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>His lesser works on logic include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Introductiones parvulorum</em>,</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Logica</em> &#39;<em>nostrorum petitioni sociorum</em>&#39;,</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Tractatus de intellectibus</em>,</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Sententiae secundum Magistrum Petrum</em>,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Abelard&#39;s works on ethics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Ethica seu Scito teipsum</em>,</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Dialogus inter Philosophum, Iudaeum, et Christianum</em>, &quot;The Dialogue of a Philosopher with a Jew and a Christian&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-{=html}">&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><em>Carmen ad Astralabium</em>, &quot;Poem for Astralabe.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Abelard&#39;s works of philosophical theology include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Theologia</em> &#39;<em>summi boni</em>&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-{=html}">&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Theologia christiana</em>,</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Theologia</em> &#39;<em>scholarium</em>&#39;,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is these works that created many problems for Abelard and they had to be revised. The first version of the <em>Theology summi boni</em>  was the treatise objected to by the Council of Soisssons, which resulted in his temporary exile. While <em>Theologia</em> &#39;<em>scholarium</em>&#39; was condemned at the Council of Sens, was the bone of contention between Abelard and St Bernard of Clairvaux. Abelard also wrote several commentaries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Expositio orationis dominicae</em>, &quot;Analysis of the Lord&#39;s Prayer.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Expositio symboli Apostolorum</em>, &quot;Analysis of the Apostle&#39;s Creed.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Expositio fidei in symbolum Athanasii</em>, &quot;Analysis of Faith in the Athanasian Creed.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Hexaëmeron</em>, &quot;Commentary on <em>Genesis</em> 1--2:25.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos</em>, &quot;Commentary on St. Paul&#39;s Letter to the Romans.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Abelard questioned notions of faith and reason in a short work:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Soliloquium</em>, &quot;Soliloquy.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Abelard composed the highly influential <em>Sic et non</em>, (For and Against), citing published arguments for and against a series of questions, 158 in all.</p>

    title: "Litanies In Catholic Liturgy",
    description: "Litanies are a form of prayer characterised by a series of invocations and responses, often used to petition God or the saints for intercession. They are a structured way to express praise, supplication, and petition, and can be found in various Christian traditions. Litanies frequently invoke the intercession of saints, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and angels, reflecting the belief that these figures can plead with God on behalf of those who pray.\n",
    content: `<p>The theology behind litanies highlights the importance of both individual and communal prayer, the power of intercession, and the role of repetition in deepening faith and spiritual connection. In communal settings, litanies foster a sense of unity and shared devotion among those participating in the prayer. Repetition in this regard is a means of focusing the mind on the prayer itself and releasing our thoughts from everyday concerns.</p>
<p>Litanies also include elements of praise and adoration, recognising the attributes and power of the divine. Litanies often draw on biblical themes and language, connecting the prayers to the broader narrative of salvation history.</p>
<p>Beyond public worship, litanies can also be a valuable tool for personal reflection and spiritual growth, allowing individuals to explore their relationship with God and the saints.</p>
<p>The theology of litanies centres on repetitive, structured prayer that uses rhythm and repetition to foster a deeper connection to God and the community of saints,</p>
<p><strong>Key theological concepts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meditation and focus:</strong> The repetitive, rhythmic nature of a litany helps calm the mind, manage distraction, and draw the person into a deeper state of prayer and contemplation. This meditative quality allows the words to become a source of focus and comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Communal participation:</strong> Litanies are often performed as a dialogue between a leader and a congregation, highlighting the theology of the communion of saints. By invoking the saints and responding to their petitions, individuals insert themselves into a larger community of faith, both living and departed.</p>
<p><strong>Faith and trust:</strong> The repeated phrases are a way to demonstrate and reinforce faith and trust in God. The familiar, well-worn words function as a friend and a guide, especially when a person feels unable to express their own prayers.</p>
<p><strong>Praise and supplication:</strong> Many litanies, such as the Marian litanies, are structured with alternating praise and supplication. This creates a stream of prayer that is characterized by both persistent praise (<em>Virgo clemens</em>) and a plea for intercession (<em>Ora pro nobis</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Sanctification:</strong> The litany is seen as a tool for sanctification, offering a structured way to bring one&#39;s life into alignment with God&#39;s will. The repeated themes, like those found in the <em>Litany of the Sacred Heart</em>, can help turn a home into a sanctuary and weave a family closer to Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Historical and biblical roots:</strong> The practice has roots in ancient forms of prayer, such as the response in Psalm 136 (&quot;for his mercy endures for ever&quot;) or the canticle of Daniel. The historical use of litanies in public worship and private devotion underscores their long-standing theological importance.</p>
<p>We offer a range of litanies, either to suit the Liturgical Calendar, or your special devotions. Some popular litanies are listed below.</p>

    title: "Novena to the Holy Spirit",
    intro: "This Novena is designed to be recited from the Friday before the Feast of the Ascension to the Vigil Feast of Pentecost Sunday, whether the Feast of the Ascension is transferred to the Sunday, or not. However, as with all novenas, they are free to recite any time by the faithful.",
    content: `<p>Our Novena has been amalgamated from two Novenas. The first is the Imprimatur of a Novena granted by Patrick O&#39;Boyle, Archbishop of Washington, to the capital&#39;s Cathedral, in March 1948, with excerpts reproduced from <em>My Catholic Life</em>. The second is the special novena drafted by the Westminster Diocese Vocations Team to help us grow in personal holiness, drafted in 2020, especially for pilgrims to the Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham. There are many similarities between the two; for example, the Consecration to the Holy Spirit, and the dedication of each day of the Novena to a special gift of the Holy Spirit. The language has been updated to modern usage.</p>
<p>Novenas in honour of the Holy Ghost are among the oldest of all novenas used by Catholics. Addressed to the beloved Third Person of the Blessed Trinity, it is a powerful plea for the light, piety, strength, and love needed by all of us. Traditionally, they are substantial bodies of prayer, reflecting the spiritual depth of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>St John Vianney once preached: &quot;When we have the Holy Spirit, the heart expands and bathes itself in divine love. And so, we should say every morning, &#39;O God, send me Thy Spirit to teach me what I am and what Thou art.</p>
<p>The Novena begins with an Act of Consecration.</p>
<p><strong>Act of Consecration to the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
<p>**(**<em>To be said each day of the Novena)</em></p>
<p>I bow before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses and offer myself, body and soul to You, the Eternal Spirit of God. I adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of Your justice, and the might of Your love. You are the strength and light of my soul. In You I live and move. I desire never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace and I pray with all my heart to be kept from the smallest sin against You.</p>
<p>Mercifully guard my every thought. Grant that I may always watch for Your light, listen to Your voice, and follow Your gracious inspirations. I give myself to You and ask You, by Your compassion to watch over me in my weakness. Mindful of the suffering of Jesus, meditating on His Holy Wounds, trusting in His Precious Blood, and adoring His stricken heart, I implore You, Adorable Spirit, helper of my infirmity, to keep me in Your grace that I may never sin against You.</p>
<p>Give me grace, O Holy Spirit, Spirit of the Father, and the Son to say to You always and everywhere, &quot;Speak Lord for Your servant is listening.&quot;</p>
<p>Mindful of your Church and its people, I ask you Father to pour out Your Spirit upon us and grant us a new vision of Your glory, a new experience of Your power, a new faithfulness to Your Word and a new consecration to Your service so that Your love may grow among us.</p>
<p>Lord Jesus, let Your Spirit rest upon our parishes, schools and homes that they may be places of love and truth where the weak are made strong and the strong learn humility and all of us learn the wisdom that alone comes from You.</p>
<p>Holy Spirit, Comforter and Sanctifier, temper our hearts that we may accept Your love. Renew our minds that we may know Your truth. Strengthen our will that we may follow You faithfully, through Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
<p><strong>Prayer for the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
<p>**(**<em>To be said each day of the Novena)</em></p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, before ascending into heaven You promised to send the Holy Spirit to finish Your work in the souls of Your Apostles and Disciples. Grant the same Holy Spirit to me that He may perfect in my soul, the work of Your grace and Your love.</p>
<p>Grant me the Spirit of Wisdom that I may despise the perishable things of this world and desire only the things that are eternal. Give me the Spirit of Understanding to enlighten my mind with the light of Your divine truth; the Spirit of Counsel that I may always choose the way of pleasing You and gaining heaven; the Spirit of Fortitude that I may bear my cross with You and overcome with courage all the obstacles that oppose my salvation; the Spirit of Knowledge that I may know You and myself and grow perfect on the path to holiness; the Spirit of Piety that I may seek to serve You and Your Church; and the Spirit of Fear and Awe that I may be filled with a loving reverence towards You, and dread to displease You in any way. Mark me, dear Lord, with the sign of Your true disciples and inspire me in all things with Your Spirit. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Day One -- The Gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong><br><em>Holy Spirit! Lord of light!<br>From Thy clear celestial height,<br>Thy pure beaming radiance give!</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> Our mighty and eternal God, who baptised us by water and the Holy Ghost, has given us the means to achieve the forgiveness of all our sins and to aspire to live in His ways of mercy and love. It is from love and his unbounded mercy that he sent down from heaven His sevenfold Spirit: the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and Fortitude, the Spirit of Knowledge and Piety, and fill us with the Spirit of Holy Fear, so that we can know Him, love and serve Him in this world and be happy with Him in the next.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer:</strong> *  Holy Spirit, perfect my soul, to understand Jesus&#39; grace and love. Grant me the Spirit of Wisdom that I may despise the perishable things of this world and aspire only after the things that are eternal. Grant me the Spirit of Understanding to enlighten my mind and the Spirit of Counsel that I may ever choose the surest way of pleasing God. Give me the Spirit of Fortitude that I may overcome with courage all the obstacles that oppose my salvation. Give me the Spirit of Knowledge that I may know God and know myself and grow perfect in the science of the Saints. Grant me the Spirit of Piety that I may find the service of God sweet and amiable and the Spirit of Fear, that I may be filled with a loving reverence towards God and may dread to displease Him in any way. Mark me, dear Lord, with the sign of Your true disciples and animate me in all things with Your Spirit. Amen.*</p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Two - The Gift of the Fear of God</strong></p>
<p><em>Holy Spirit, come Thou, Father of the poor!<br>Come, treasure which endures!<br>Come Thou, Light of all that live.</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> This gift brings us to our knees in reverence and awe before the glory and greatness of God, like Moses before the burning bush. In the heat of His love, we are confronted with all that is unworthy within us---those attitudes and patterns of behaviour which threaten to separate us from Him. In His greatness, we see our smallness.</p>
<p>And yet, we are not crushed nor led into despair. For the Fear of the Lord gives us not only the desire not to offend God, but also the hope that God will give us the grace that we need in order to truly live lives pleasing to Him.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong>: <em>Come, O blessed Spirit of Holy Fear, penetrate my innermost heart, that I may set Thee, my Lord and God, before my face forever; help me to shun all things that can offend Thee, and make me worthy to appear before the pure eyes of Thy Divine Majesty in heaven, where Thou live and reign in the unity of the Blessed Trinity, God, world without end. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Three - The Gift of Piety</strong></p>
<p><em>Holy Spirit, thou, of all consolers, best,<br>Visiting the troubled breast,<br>Dost refreshing peace bestow.</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> The gift of Piety creates in our hearts a filial affection for God as our most loving Father. It inspires us to love and respect for His sake, persons and things consecrated to Him, as well as those who are vested with His authority. This includes His Blessed Mother and the Saints, our beloved Church, the Pope, and clergy, as well as our parents and families.</p>
<p>The penitent who is filled with the gift of Piety finds the practice of religion not a burdensome duty but a delightful service. Where there is love, there is no labour.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong>: <em>Come, O Blessed Spirit of Piety, possess my heart. Encourage in me such a love for God that I may find satisfaction only in His service and, for His sake, and lovingly submit to His Will. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Four: The Gift of Fortitude</strong><br><em>Holy Spirit, thou in toil art comfort sweet;<br>Pleasant coolness in the heat;<br>Solace in the midst of woe.</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> By the gift of Fortitude, the soul is strengthened against natural fear and supported to the end in the performance of duty. Fortitude imparts to the will an impulse and energy which move it to undertake, without hesitancy, the most arduous tasks; to face dangers, and to endure without complaint the slow martyrdom of even lifelong tribulation. Fortitude understands that &quot;He that perseveres to the end shall be saved&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong>: <em>Come, O Blessed Spirit of Fortitude, uphold my soul in time of trouble and adversity. Sustain my efforts to achieve holiness, strengthen my weakness, and give me courage to resist all the assaults of my enemies, that I may never be overcome by them, or by evil, and be separated from Thee, my God, the greatest good. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Five The Gift of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p><em>Holy Spirit, Light immortal! Light Divine!<br>Visit Thou these hearts of Thine,<br>And our inmost being fill!</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> The gift of Knowledge enables the soul to evaluate created things at their true worth, in their relation to God. Knowledge unmasks the pretence of creatures, reveals their emptiness, and points out their only true purpose as instruments in the service of God. It shows us the loving care of God even in adversity.</p>
<p>Knowledge directs us to glorify Him in every circumstance of life. Guided by its light, we put first things first and prize the friendship of God beyond all else. Knowledge is a fountain of life to those that possess it.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong> <em>Come, O Blessed Spirit of Knowledge, and grant that I may perceive the will of the Father; show me the nothingness of earthly things, that I may realise their vanity and use them only for Thy glory and my own salvation, looking ever beyond them to Thee and Thy eternal rewards. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Six: The Gift of Understanding</strong></p>
<p><em>Holy Spirit, if Thou take Thy grace away,<br>Nothing pure in man will stay,<br>All his good is turned to ill.</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> Understanding, as a gift of the Holy Ghost, helps us to grasp the meaning of the truths of our beloved faith. It enables us to penetrate the inner meaning of revealed truths, and through them to be quickened to newness of life. Our faith ceases to be sterile and inactive. Instead, it inspires a way of life that bears eloquent testimony to the faith within us. We begin to walk worthy of God, act in ways that are pleasing to Him, and come to understand the immense depths of his love, mercy, and glory.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong>: <em>Come, O Spirit of Understanding, and enlighten our minds, that we may know and believe all the mysteries of salvation; and may merit at last to see the eternal light in Thy Light; and in the light of glory, to have a clear vision of Thee and the Father and the Son. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Seven: The Gift of Counsel</strong></p>
<p><em>Holy Spirit, heal our wounds ~ our strength renew;<br>On our dryness pour Thy dew!<br>Wash the stains of guilt away!</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> The gift of Counsel endows the soul with prudence, enabling it to judge promptly and rightly what must be done, especially in difficult circumstances. Counsel applies the principles furnished by Knowledge and Understanding to the innumerable challenges that confront us in the course of our daily duty as parents, teachers, public servants, and as Catholics.</p>
<p>Counsel is common sense. Given by the Holy Spirit, it is a priceless treasure in the quest of salvation. This is why we pray to the Most High, that He may direct us in the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong>: <em>Come, O Spirit of Counsel, help and guide me in all my ways, that I may always do Thy holy will. Incline my heart to that which is good; turn it away from all that is evil, and direct me by the straight path of Thy commandments to that goal of eternal life for which I long. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Eight: The Gift of Wisdom</strong><br><em>Holy Spirit, bend the stubborn heart and will;<br>Melt the frozen, warm the chill;<br>Guide the steps that go astray!</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> Embodying all the other gifts, Wisdom is the most perfect of the gifts. Of Wisdom it is written, &quot;all good things come to me with her, and innumerable riches, through her hands&quot;. It is the gift of Wisdom that strengthens our faith, fortifies hope, perfects charity, and promotes the practice of virtue in the highest degree. Wisdom enlightens the mind to discern and relish things divine. It distances us from those activities that take us away from Jesus. It also helps us understand that the Cross of Christ yields a divine sweetness. As Jesus said: &quot;Accept thy cross and follow me, for my yoke is sweet and my burden light.&quot;</p>
<p>The gift of wisdom is a journey into the heart of God. As the well-known prayer says: &quot;Come, O Spirit of Wisdom! Bend our proud hearts and stubborn wills. Empty us of all folly and façade, and reveal to us the mysteries of Your ways so that we may follow You in humility and trust&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong>: <em>Come, O Spirit of Wisdom, and reveal to my soul the mysteries of heavenly things, their exceeding greatness, power, and beauty. Teach me to love them above and beyond all the passing joys and satisfactions of earth. Help me to attain them and possess them forever. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Day Nine: The Fruits of the Holy Spirit</strong><br><em>Holy Spirit, thou, on those who evermore<br>Thee confess, and Thee adore,<br>In Thy sevenfold gifts, descend:</em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will renew the face of the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>MEDITATION:</strong> The gifts of the Holy Spirit perfect our virtues by enabling us to practice them with greater docility to divine inspiration. As we grow in the knowledge and love of God, our service becomes more sincere and generous and the practice of virtue, more perfect. Such acts of virtue leave the heart filled with joy and consolation and are known as Fruits of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The gifts we have prayed for will bear rich fruit in our lives, not for our own glory but for the glory of God. For which of these fruits do I most hunger? In imitation of the Blessed Virgin, we are invited to give birth to new life through the Holy Spirit working within us. May each one of us, by responding generously to God&#39;s calling, bring forth fruit in the Church as a living branch of the true vine which is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong>: <em>Come, O Divine Spirit, fill my heart with Thy heavenly fruits: charity, joy, peace, patience, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, modesty, self-control and chastity, that I may never weary in the service of God, but by continued faithful submission to Thy inspiration, may merit to be united eternally with Thee in the love of the Father and the Son. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>Please recite one Our Father; one Hail Mary; and seven times the Glory be</em></p>
<p><strong>Additional prayers to the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Veni Creator Spiritus</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Come Holy Spirit, Creator come, from thy bright heavenly throne. Come take possession of my soul and make it all thine own. Thou who are called the Paraclete, best gift of God above, the living spring, the living fire, sweet unction, and true love. Thou who are sevenfold in thy grace, finger of God&#39;s right hand. Your promise, teaching little ones, to speak and understand. O guide my mind with thy blest light, with love my heart inflame. And with thy strength which ne&#39;er decays, confirm my mortal frame. Far from me drive the deadly foe. True peace unto me bring. And through all perils lead me safe, beneath thy sacred Wing.</em></p>
<p><em>Through Thee may I the Father know. Through Thee the Blessed Son. And thee the Spirit of them both, thrice blessed, three in one. All glory to the Father be, and his co-equal Son. My love for Thee, Great Paraclete, will last through ages run.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>A prayer for Help from the Holy Spirit</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Heavenly Father, hear my prayer. Send me the Paraclete, the Comforter. May He cleanse my heart and my soul, protect me from peril and temptation, enlighten my mind, and create in me a loving and pure heart, in thrall to Thee, so that my life will bear witness to your eternal power and glory. I ask this through Christ,</em></p>`,

    title: "April",
    description: "Easter Sunday celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, a pivotal event that forms the cornerstone of the Christian faith. It signifies Jesus\\'s victory over sin and death, offering humanity the promise of eternal life and redemption. Easter is a time for Catholics to rejoice in this victory, reflect on its significance, and embrace the new life offered through Christ\\'s resurrection. Here\\'s a deeper look into the meaning of Easter.\n",
    content: `<p>As we celebrate Easter, it is important that we understand that the resurrection of Jesus is not just a historical episode, it is the central tenet of Catholic belief. St Paul explains in his letter to the Christian community in Corinth that &quot;If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:17). St Paul&#39;s admonition recognises that the Resurrection is not only Christ&#39;s triumph over death, but also it is God&#39;s gift to humanity. To paraphrase Romans 6:4, St Paul writes &quot;Just as Christ was raised ... we too might walk in newness of life.&quot;</p>
<p>What does St Paul mean by this? While the crucifixion is the means of the redemption of our sins, the Resurrection is the source of our spiritual rebirth. This grace is not metaphorical---it&#39;s the promise of real participation in divine life. It signifies Jesus&#39;s victory over sin and death, offering humanity the promise of eternal life and redemption. Easter then is a time for Catholics to rejoice in this victory, reflect on its significance, and embrace the new life offered through Christ&#39;s resurrection The Resurrection transforms suffering and death---not by removing them, but by giving them meaning and the certainty of God&#39;s fidelity. As the First Epistle of St Peter (1:3) says, &quot;He has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ....&quot;</p>
<p>It is a theme that has special relevance for St Saviour&#39;s Church this year. The recently deceased Holy Father, Pope Francis, decided that 2025 is a year of Jubilee, something which happens every 25 years. The theme is &quot;Pilgrims of Hope,&quot; and it is a year of hope for a world suffering the impacts of war, the ongoing effects of COVID-19 pandemic, and a climate crisis. As St Saviour&#39;s has been designated as a Sanctuary Church this year, this theme of hope provides our parishioners with special resonance. We celebrate the resurrection as an affirmation of our belief in the victory of light over darkness, life over death. Easter Sunday is a time of renewal and rebirth, symbolising the beginning of a new chapter in the life of the Church and the world.</p>
<p>As a special grace, the Resurrection also brings us deeper into the community of the Risen Christ. After the Resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples (up to 500 of them) and to his closest friends, the Apostles, Mary of Magdala and, equally significantly, two of his followers on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). Initially, they do not seem to recognise him. Jesus walks with them, and they discuss the events surrounding his crucifixion, including the women&#39;s report of the empty tomb. Jesus asked them what they were discussing, and they shared their disappointment, expressing their hopes that Jesus was the one who would redeem Israel. He then gently chides them for their lack of faith in the prophets and kindly explains how the Messiah was prophesied to suffer before entering his glory. Finally, the disciples recognise Jesus when he breaks bread with them, and he then vanishes. And in the immediate aftermath of this encounter, we come to understand how deeply his teaching and his appearance has touched their hearts. Their first thought is to share the good news with their community.</p>
<p>Similarly, the meeting Jesus has with his Apostles on the shore of the Sea of Tiberias (also known as the Sea of Galilee) after his resurrection carries equal significance. Some of the Apostles, including Peter, were fishing and had caught nothing all night. Jesus, standing on the shore, instructed them to cast their net on the right side of the boat, which almost capsized after a miraculously large catch of fish. The disciple whom Jesus loved recognises him, and Peter, hearing it was the Lord, swims to shore. Both these apparitions emphasise Jesus&#39;s restoration of the faith of his disciples and his continued provision for them, even when unrecognised.</p>
<p>The Resurrection then is not the end of the story. In fact, it is the foundation of the Church&#39;s mission. Before Jesus ascends to his rightful home, he promises the care, inspiration, and love of the Holy Spirit, which gives the Apostles the fire and drive to go out to spread the Good News, not as witnesses of a doctrine, but as a living encounter with the divine. It gives them the strength, to quote the Gospel of Matthew (28:19) to &quot;Go therefore and make disciples ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Our celebration of Easter invites us to receive these graces anew and to carry the gifts that God has deigned to give us, in worship and thanks at every Mass, in every prayer we recite and in every act of love, every moment of trust we give, every day. And we do this in the knowledge that the Christ always walks beside us, unseen, but never absent.</p>`,

    content: `<p>SPIRITUAL THOUGHT FOR AUGUST 10th 2025</p>
<p>The Sacred Heart of Our Lady, often referred to as the Immaculate Heart of Mary, celebrates the interior life of the Blessed Virgin. We have spoken in recent homilies the purity of the interior life of Our Lady, her particular love for God and for, of course, Jesus. It also encompasses her compassion for us, for humanity, interceding for all who seek her help and guidance.  Our Lady&#39;s Immaculate/Sacred Heart serves as a m highlights her role as a model of discipleship and guide on our path to holiness. She is a model for how Christians should love God, strive for purity, and offer compassion to others.</p>
<p>The heart is sometimes depicted pierced with swords, symbolising her seven sorrows; or encircled by a crown of thorns, thereby linking her to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It links the two devotions, underscoring the importance of unconditional love, reparation for sins (our own and those of humanity) and their role as exemplars of selfless worship of God.</p>
<p>Through many of her apparitions, such as at Lourdes in France and Fatima in Portugal, carry the message of the importance of our consecration of our lives to Our Lady&#39;s Immaculate Heart. It supports and encourages us on our hopeful path to salvation and our pilgrim acts of reparation for sins against God; emphasised by her request that Russia be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. The request was deemed so important that Pope Pius XII consecrated the world to her Immaculate Heart in 1942. This was done twice more by Pope St John Paul II in 1982 and 1983.</p>
<p>Why did they do this. They recognised the devotion is given to us as a gift. It is also an invitation to love and accept the mysteries of our faith and the love of Jesus and Our Lady for the world. The question is: how do we respond?</p>
<p>Prayer to the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady: <em>O Mary, Virgin most powerful and Mother of mercy, Queen of Heaven and Refuge of sinners, we consecrate ourselves to thine Immaculate Heart. We consecrate to thee our very being and our whole life; all that we have, all that we love, all that we are.</em></p>`,

    description: "Catholic feast days in February include the Presentation of the Lord (Candlemas) on February 2nd, and the feasts of Saints Scholastica, Cyril and Methodius, and the Chair of Saint Peter on the 22nd. Other notable days include memorials for Saints Agatha, Paul Miki and companions, and the Seven Founders of the Servite Order. The Sundays in February are the 5th, 6th, and 7th Sundays in Ordinary Time.\n",
    content: `<p>At this time of year many young people in St Saviour&#39;s Parish will assume the sacrament of Confirmation. What does this mean? The sacrament of Confirmation is conferred through the anointing with chrism on the forehead, which is done by the laying on of the hand, and through the words: <em>&#39;Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti&#39;</em> [Be sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.].&quot; it is fitting to consider the sign of anointing and what it signifies and imprints: a spiritual seal. The Catechism of the Church tells us: &quot;It is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.&quot;</p>
<p>A seal is a symbol of a person, a sign of personal authority, or ownership of an object. The seal of the Holy Spirit marks our total belonging to Christ, our enrolment in his service. Because of this meaning, it cannot be approached lightly, as just another ceremony in the Catholic liturgy. Confirmation must be done willingly and with aforethought. The celebrant must understand the mystical bond that is created by Confirmation between the himself or herself and the divine before acceptance. The bishop asks if the celebrant accepts the seal through anointing and the celebrant by stepping up to be anointed shows his or her desire to be sealed. <br><br>There is also a historical aspect to Confirmation. It is a practice that joins us to our Catholic antecedents who also accepted the seal of the Holy Spirit going back thousands of years. Anointing itself is a long-recognised practice replete with meaning. Oil is a sign of abundance and joy; it cleanses (anointing before and after a bath) and limbers the body (the anointing of athletes and wrestlers). Oil is a sign of healing, since it is soothing to bruises and wounds; and it helps the skin, making it radiant with beauty, health, and strength.</p>
<p>The chrism the Church uses is a mixture of pure oil of olives and balsam that is blessed by a bishop. Used in sacraments such as Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders, it is also used in the consecration of churches, chalices, patens, altars, altar-stones, and in the solemn blessing of bells and baptismal water. The oil signifies the copious outpouring of grace and strength. Balsam typifies the sweetness of Christian virtue, which protects from the corruption of sin<br> <br>Anointing with chrism oil has parallel meanings in the sacramental life of the Church. The pre-baptismal anointing with the oil of catechumens signifies cleansing and strengthening; the anointing of the sick (at our afternoon First Friday masses) expresses healing and comfort. The post-baptismal anointing with sacred chrism in Confirmation and ordination is the sign of consecration. By Confirmation Christians, that is, those who are anointed, share more completely in the mission of Jesus Christ and the fullness of the Holy Spirit with which he is filled, so that their lives may give off &quot;the aroma of Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>The Liturgy of Confirmation is then the next important step in the life of a Catholic that began with Baptism. In the ceremony of Confirmation confirmands are invited to renew their baptismal promises and the profession of faith. It marks a special turning point in our lives, when we are old enough to understand the glory, tenets and demands of our faith and yet still walk towards the celebrant to accept the seal of the Holy Spirit. It confirms not only our belief in the divine, but also our free acceptance of the expectations this puts on us as Catholics. This is love.</p>
<p>............................................................................................................................................................ <br>In the sacrament of Confirmation, the bishop extends his hands over the whole group of the confirmands. Since the time of the apostles this gesture has signified the gift of the Spirit. The bishop invokes the outpouring of the Spirit in these words:<br> <br><em>All-powerful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by water and the Holy Spirit<br>you freed your sons and daughters from sin and gave them new life.<br>Send your Holy Spirit upon them to be their helper and guide.<br>Give them the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of right judgment and courage,<br>the spirit of knowledge and reverence.<br>Fill them with the spirit of wonder and awe in your presence. We ask this through Christ our Lord.</em></p>
<p>As we come to witness the confirmation of our young parishioners let us ponder the deep significance of these words in our hearts.</p>`,

    description: "In January 2025, some significant Catholic feast days include the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God on January 1st, the Epiphany of the Lord on January 5th, and the Baptism of the Lord on January 12th. The Feast of the Holy Family is celebrated on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year\\'s Day, which in 2025 falls on December 29th, 2024.\n",
    content: `<p>The last verse of the beautiful hymn, <em>Like the dawning of the morning</em>, contains the lines: Thou hast waited, Child of David! And thy waiting now is o&#39;er! Thou hast seen Him Blessed Mother! And wilt see him evermore! Oh! His Human Face and Features, They were passing sweet to see; Thou beholdest them this moment; Mother, show them now to me! These lines hold high the promise of the Christmas Season and the hope of a new and better tomorrow, based on our faith in the Christ and his message of salvation, which gives us hope we will, one day, see Him in all his glory in Heaven. What an illuminating and lifting message.</p>
<p>The Hymn underscores the meaning of family: first, the glory of the Holy Family, the key protagonists of this Church season. To underscore this point, on January 1^st^ we honour Our Lady, the mother of the Christ, followed by the celebration of the Holy Family on January 2^nd^. These feasts mirror the substance of our own family relationships, as well as the importance of our extended family, the Church.</p>
<p>It is easy to fall in line with the accepted terms that the Holy Family is a perfect template for our own family life; based on faith, love and self-sacrifice in the interests of the whole. And we might consider that in comparing our own, sometimes tortured, stressful and/or estranged family relationships that we fail by comparison.</p>
<p>It is true that the Holy Family is a perfect entity, and we honour Our Lady and St Joseph as exemplars. Nonetheless, their family life was not easy by any means. Our image of them as perfect vessels is almost tragically, ironic, given how complicated their lives were. Although Our Lady&#39;s pregnancy was part of God&#39;s plan, it must have felt deeply unplanned in the context of Mary and Joseph&#39;s relationship; and her relationship with her parents and extended family.  The Gospel of St Matthew&#39;s homes in on the depth of faith Joseph had in God, which committed him to Our Lady, even after discovering his betrothed pregnant. St Luke meanwhile focuses on Our Lady welcoming the words of the angel Gabriel, in the Magnificat, despite the weighty consequences of her accepting God&#39;s wishes.</p>
<p>From that point, the lives of Our Lady and St Joseph didn&#39;t get any easier: they found no welcome in Bethlehem, and were reduced to spending days in a stable, housing cattle. And soon after, had to flee as refugees to Egypt to escape persecution, and likely death, by Herod&#39;s soldiers. Then the practicalities of a refugee life took over as both had to rebuild their lives from scratch in a new country and make it a loving and viable home for the child Jesus.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a tableau that, sadly, can readily be recognised today, in conflict zones, such as Palestine (how ironic), in Ukraine, in Yemen, in Syria, and even, in these days of austerity, on the streets of the UK, Argentina and anywhere where economic policy leaves many stranded, homeless and fearful.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, it is the overcoming of suffering and strife, while still maintaining their commitment to God and to each other, that is the true message of the Holy Family. It is one that many of us in the Catholic Church can identify with, as we walk our own, sometimes difficult pilgrim journey.  At the core though, the Holy Family symbolises hope: in God, for his plan for them, and in our faith in God&#39;s plan for each of us.</p>
<p>May God bless you with a happy and fulfilling year ahead for you, and your families; the dawning of many happy mornings for you all.</p>`,

    title: "July",
    description: "July 3^rd^ was the feast day of St Thomas the Apostle. As July opens and the Feast of the Sacred Heart brought June to a close, we look at the nature and constancy of our faith. I think St Thomas's natural disbelief that Christ had risen from the tomb is an example of the inner turmoil in our hearts as and when we face challenging times.\n",
    content: `<p>Imagine the shock, fear, hurt and loneliness of St Thomas in the days after the Crucifixion, one of the most horrid and painful deaths devised by the Romans. Returning to the home of the Apostles and hearing that Jesus is in fact risen and the no doubt frantic exclamations of his fellow disciplines, is it unreasonable to surmise that St Thomas would express surprise and doubt? Wouldn&#39;t it be natural for a practical man to state that he wouldn&#39;t believe it unless he could see for himself the risen Christ and touch his wounds?</p>
<p>And then, the denouement. That moment when Christ appeared and kindly laid his wound for Thomas to see and touch, and the heartrending moment when Thomas falls on his knees and in awe cries, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; It is a moment of both sorrow and hope. Sorrow for the momentary lapse in faith, and hope of an entirely new tomorrow. It was a moment of full realisation that the man he had shared troubles, debate, bread and wine with, was truly the Son of God. That defining moment opened the gate to eternity for Thomas as he literally touched the divine. It was transformative. It would turn his mind and his heart from earth to Heaven, from doubt to certainty, from independence to submission to God&#39;s design and set his pilgrim journey on a path to missionary glory.</p>
<p>The theology of &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; emphases that true faith often requires personal evidence, but is ultimately about believing without seeing. The story, found in  the Gospel of John, Chapter 20. highlights the human need for proof, the grace of Jesus in providing it, and a profound declaration of faith when Thomas witnesses the resurrected Christ. It serves as a bridge between the original witnesses and later believers, while also affirming that faith without direct sight is blessed. Thomas&#39;s scepticism is presented as a rational and understandable desire for proof, mirroring the physical experience his fellow apostles had already received. He famously stated, &quot;Unless I see the mark of the nails, and I put my hand into his side, I will not believe&quot;.</p>
<p>For us today, the story connects the original witnesses (the other ten disciples) to future believers (like us) who cannot have the same direct, sensory experience of Jesus. The narrative culminates with Jesus&#39;s blessing for those who have not seen and yet believe. This is a core tenet of the Christian faith, affirming that belief is possible and valuable without physical proof.</p>
<p>Our faith is Christ centric. We believe that the only way to the Father is through Christ, His Son. It&#39;s in many ways a happy faith; it has a happy ending for the constant and the faithful; a life of eternity in Heaven. It&#39;s also a challenging faith. One that requires repeated commitment. I&#39;m reminded of a well known corporate maxim: &quot;Success is never owned, it is only rented and rent is due every day.&quot; Our faith is like that too. Through good times and bad we are asked to renew our commitment and love of God, and live that commitment in big ways and small, in every way, every day. That&#39;s constancy. That&#39;s true belief. God bless you.</p>`,

    title: "March",
    description: "In March 2025, the Catholic Church celebrates several important feast days, including the Solemnity of the Annunciation, the feast of St. Patrick, and the start of Lent with Ash Wednesday. Additionally, the liturgical calendar includes the Sundays of Lent, the feasts of the Saints of the early church, Perpetua and Felicity, and of course, St. Joseph. In fact, the month of March is dedicated to Saint Joseph, the foster father of Jesus and spouse of the Virgin Mary. Catholics are encouraged to deepen their devotion to St. Joseph during this month, reflecting on his virtues and seeking his intercession. The major feast day associated with this devotion is the Solemnity of St. Joseph on March 19th.\n",
    content: `<p>Lent begins in early March this year. As we celebrate Ash Wednesday on the March 5^th^ and enter into an extended period of spiritual reflection, it might be useful to think on the themes of redemption and salvation and what they mean for us as Catholics. On paper, redemption and salvation go hand in hand. In real life they do not. Although these are words which are often used interchangeably by Christians there are, in fact, key differences between the two.</p>
<p>The word redemption is derived from the Latin Vulgate word <em>redemptio</em>; a rendering of the Hebrew word <em>kopher</em> and the Greek word <em>lytron</em> which means the price of ransom in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>According to the Catechism, redemption is the act of Christ giving his life as a ransom for humanity&#39;s sins. This act of redemption allows people to be freed from sin and restored to a relationship with God. Redemption is the first step of salvation and the first part of our life as a child of God, which enables us to enjoy the riches of His Grace.</p>
<p>However, our lives as children of God does not begin and end in redemption. After we are redeemed from our sins and reconciled with God, we begin the process of salvation. In the Council of Trent, salvation from sin begins with the grace of God touching a sinner&#39;s heart and calling him to repent. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines salvation as the opportunity for humans to be saved from sin through faith in Jesus Christ. The Catechism also states that the Catholic Church is the universal hope for salvation.</p>
<p>The grace of salvation is a product of the love and mercy of God and it is our choice whether to receive this grace or reject it. As Catholics we believe in the revelation and promises of God, we fear God&#39;s justice and we hope in His mercy, we trust that God will be merciful to us for Christ&#39;s sake, we begin to love God as the source of all justice and we begin to hate sin.</p>
<p>If we choose to receive grace, we choose a life aligned with the will of God but it we don&#39;t receive it, we remain in a life of sin. This involves the sanctification and renewal of our inner selves through our voluntary reception of God&#39;s grace and gifts. This inner transformation will manifest in the way we live our lives and how we treat others. Salvation therefore is not a one-time event. It is not simply accepting the grace of God, it involves constantly choosing a Christian way of life and following the teachings of the church.</p>
<p>Salvation and redemption are beautiful gifts that we are all very blessed to receive. Lent is the perfect time for us to reflect on this gift and the positive affirmation we each make to accept the Grace of God.</p>
<p>...........................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>PRAYER BEFORE A CRUCIFIX</p>
<p>One of the beautiful prayers of the Church is the Prayer before a Crucifix. Say <em>Our Father, Hail Mary</em> and the <em>Glory Be</em> for the Catholic Church and the intentions of the Holy Father. A plenary indulgence, may be gained by those who shall say this prayer with devotion before an image of our crucified Redeemer after the Mass each Friday in Lent. A partial indulgence may also be gained for each devout recitation.</p>
<p><em>Behold O king and sweet Jesus, I cast myself on my knees in thy sight; and with the most fervent desire of my soul, I pray and beseech Thee to impress upon my heart lively sentiments of faith, hope, and charity, with true repentance for my sins and firm desire of amendment. Whilst with deep affection and grief of soul I ponder within myself and mentally contemplate Thy five most precious wounds, having before mine eyes that which David spoke in prophecy of Thee, my good Jesus: They have pierced My hands and My feet, they have numbered all My bones.&quot;</em></p>`,

    title: "Spiritual Thought for May",
    description: "When Jesus says, \\\"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\\\" (John 14:6), it emphasises Jesus\\' unique role as the mediator between God and humanity, and that belief in and relationship with Jesus is the only way to experience a relationship with God.\n",
    content: `<p>Spiritual thoughts have a special role in the life of the faithful. They help shape one&#39;s relationship with God, guide moral actions, and foster personal growth. As the book of Proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7 says, &quot;For as he thinks in his heart, so is he.&quot; This proverb highlights the profound connection between our thoughts and our being. It is also a call. A call to find out more about our faith; deepen our understanding of its tenets and know why we believe what we believe. This &quot;theology of aspiration&quot; refers to the Christian belief that individuals are called to a deep, lifelong pursuit of God, expressed through both formal and informal prayer. This includes the practice of short, prayerful exclamations called aspirations or ejaculatory prayers, and a more general life-long commitment to grow in one&#39;s faith and love for God.</p>
<p>In other words, Catholic texts say that our thoughts are not just internal musings but have the power to influence our actions and shape our character. Therefore, cultivating positive and God-centred thoughts is essential for a fulfilling spiritual life. Our aspiration is, of course, a deep desire to please God: a central theme is the desire to live a life that honours and glorifies God, rooted in faith and a transformed heart. This is seen as a response to God&#39;s grace. The concept is supported by numerous scriptures, such as Psalm 42:1-2&#39;s description of a soul &quot;longing after&quot; God and Philippians 3:10-14, where the Apostle Paul speaks of &quot;straining toward what is ahead&quot; to &quot;press on toward the goal&quot;.</p>
<p>We also aspire through prayer. These are simple, heartfelt prayers intended to be repeated throughout the day to maintain a connection with God, such as &quot;Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I love you; save souls&quot; or &quot;Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all my trust in You&quot;. They are seen as a way to &quot;pray without ceasing&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:17). The aspiration to please God: A central theme is the desire to live a life that honours and glorifies God, rooted in faith and a transformed heart. Aspiration also refers to the long-term pursuit of spiritual maturity and holiness, often described as putting off the &quot;old self&quot; and putting on the &quot;new self&quot;. This is understood as a response to God&#39;s grace. The effectiveness of these prayers depends on the intention behind them. They must be used with a sincere desire to honor God, not carelessly.</p>
<p>Aspirations are not limited to formal prayer; they can include making one&#39;s work or creative endeavours, such as art or music, an offering to God. In essence, the theology of aspiration emphasizes a continuous, intentional, and active journey toward God, using both focused, short prayers and a life-long pursuit of spiritual growth and holiness.</p>`,

    title: "September",
    description: "As summer draws to its close and our children begin new school terms, we welcome parishioners back from their holidays. As we noted in the last newsletter, this Jubilee Year of Hope encourages us to renew our trust in God's creation, deepen our spiritual journeys and work for peace and reconciliation. This year, for the first time, St Saviour's joined in the ecumenical Walk for Peace. We made new friends, opened up new alliances, and found common cause to commit ourselves to the wider community and reconciliation between faiths. The church's celebrations in September, which also include the important feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, encourages us to find new joy and purpose in our pilgrim journey.\n",
    content: `<p>In a sense, the Walk for Peace was timely. It underscored how special the month is in this Jubilee Year. As the month opened, the church celebrated the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation. All through summer Pope Leo has regularly referred to &quot;seeds of peace and hope&quot; in his speeches, clearly referring to the late Pope Francis&#39; encyclical, <em>Laudato Si</em>, calling for action to heal the Earth and to find reconciliation in conflict zones such as Yemen, Myanmar, Gaza, and Ukraine.</p>
<p>On September 15^th^, the church will celebrate the Jubilee of Consolation, honouring those who suffer and those who serve them. Whether caring for the sick, consoling and helping prisoners, providing medical care in war zones, or supporting friends in sickness or poverty, this is hallowed work, that serves God and reveres his creation. This is followed by the celebration of the Jubilee of Justice on September 20^th^, which encourages prayer for the common good and courage in public life.</p>
<p>These celebrations help us understand that being a Catholic doesn&#39;t just involve going to church once a week. Or that God joins us in liturgy only when we go to church. God&#39;s creation, with all its joys, sufferings, challenges, and opportunities is imbued in every fibre of the fabric of our lives. The church&#39;s celebrations this month invite us to meditate on the significance of the various elements of our lives and to commit ourselves anew to our devotion to Christ and his teachings; to love God and our fellow man as we love and treat ourselves.</p>
<p>The church&#39;s celebrations in September, which also include the important feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, encourages us to find new joy and purpose in our pilgrim journey. If then, there is a theme to carry with us through the month, it is one of love.</p>
<p>The church also calls it at times, the Feast of the Triumph of the Cross. While the feast day signifies a wealth of theological meaning, on a secular level it also commemorates some key moments in Church history. It celebrates the discovery of the True Cross, by St Helena in AD 320; its exaltation for public veneration in AD 335 during the consecration of the Constantinian Basilica over the site of the crucifixion and burial of Christ; and the recovery of the Cross from the Persians in AD 628 by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius.</p>
<p>One of the theological themes of this special day is the transformation of the cross, which is associated with a cruel death, to the means by which Christ&#39;s sacrifice elevated it to a symbol of hope and new life. The cross proclaims that Jesus conquered death and evil through His crucifixion; a message underscored by the forgiveness of the thief crucified with him and the promise given to him of Heaven. The cross then became the means by which God revealed his boundless love for humanity, offering us hope for eternal life and salvation.</p>
<p>Christ&#39;s carrying of the cross paved the way for new beginnings and spiritual growth, not just for believers but for all creation, as Pope Francis underscored in his seminal encyclical <em>Laudato Si</em>. The promise of salvation then is not a personal gift, given only to the holy and the saints. It is given to the entirety of creation. Christ&#39;s sacrifice then is universal. In celebrating and praying in honour of the Triumph of the Cross, we recognise that Christ&#39;s promise of the redemption of our sins, and the hope of salvation is for all people. This theme is also emphasised by the common name given today to the feastday, the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.</p>
<p>Exaltation means lifting. It means lifting the Holy Cross high enough that it is visible to all peoples. Gazing upon the cross and seeing Christ, who is lifted on the cross, draws all peoples to his church and Himself. As parishioners of St Saviour&#39;s we recognise the power and the hope of this exaltation every time we come near our church and see the statue of the Christ held high above the belltower dominating the High Street. It calls us to worship and to love Him.</p>
<p>....................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Prayer to mark the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross</p>
<p><em>Most glorious and triumphant Lord, You gave Your life for my soul&#39;s salvation, using the most horrific act of cruelty as the means of Your redeeming grace. I open myself to that grace, asking You to bestow it superabundantly. May I have the courage and wisdom to embrace my crosses every day, uniting them to Your Cross, and trusting that You will use my sacrifices to further bestow Your love on the world. Saving Cross of Christ, have mercy on me. Jesus, I trust in You.</em></p>`,
