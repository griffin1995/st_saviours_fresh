**The Theology of the Assumption**

We celebrate the Assumption of our Blessed Lady on August 15^th^. In
Italy especially, but in many European countries, it is considered such
an important feastday that it is a national holiday. The tradition is
that those who are already on holiday at the seaside do not venture into
the sea, out of respect. But those Italians who are not on holiday
celebrate in the open, either by an extended family picnic or by a day
at the seaside, and these day trippers are allowed to venture into the
waves. In the UK, celebration of the Assumption is more discrete.
Nonetheless, given its importance to so many of St Saviour's
parishioners, we have produced this booklet to support you in your
personal love and devotions to Our Lady.

The Church and the Catechism say that Our Lady was assumed into heaven,
rather than ascended. Assumed emphasises the special relationship Our
Lady enjoys not only with Jesus, but also God the Father, and therefore
the term assumed refers to the fact that God brought her into Heaven;
she did not ascend by her own power, as Jesus did.

The Assumption of Mary is not found in Scripture. Her assumption is
based on Sacred Tradition. In other words, it is something that has
always and everywhere been believed by Catholics, through divine
revelation.

The immaculate nature of Our Lady, laid down by Pope Pius IX in 1854
explained that she was preserved free from all guilt of original sin. Fr
Michael O'Carroll, in his book, *Theotokos: A Theological Encyclopaedia
of the Blessed Virgin Mary*, writes: "We have known for some time that
there were widespread *Transitus Stories* that date from the sixth
century that teach Mary's glorious ![A black and white drawing of a

dogma of the Assumption by Pope Pius XII that rekindled interest in
these stories of the end of Mary's life". Pope Paul VI emphasised this
further in his treatise *Lumen Gentium* explaining that on the
completion of her earthly sojourn, Our Lady was taken up body and soul
into heavenly glory. There she was exalted by the Lord as Queen of the
universe, that she might be the more fully conformed to her Son, the
Lord of lords and the conqueror of sin and death (*Lumen Gentium* 59).

Devotional prayers to Our Lady of the Assumption often focus on
honouring Her bodily ascension into heaven and seeking Her intercession
for spiritual guidance and protection. These prayers frequently express
faith in her role as Queen of Heaven and Earth and ask for her prayers
for the faithful.

**Prayer to Our Lady of the Assumption \[by Pope St Pius X\]**

Immaculate virgin, mother of God and mother of humanity, we believe with
all the fervour of our faith in your triumphal assumption both in body
and in soul into heaven, where you are acclaimed as queen by all the
choirs of angels and all the legions of saints. We unite with them to
praise and bless the Lord who has exalted you above all other pure
creatures and to offer you the tribute of our devotion and our love.

We know that your gaze, which on earth watched over the humble and
suffering humanity of Jesus, in heaven is filled with the vision of that
humanity glorified and with the vision of uncreated wisdom. And that the
joy of your soul in the direct contemplation of the adorable Trinity
moves your heart with overwhelming tenderness. We poor sinners whose
body weighs down the flight of the soul, beg you to purify our hearts so
that, while we remain below, we may learn to see God and God alone in
the beauty of his creatures.

We trust that your merciful eyes will look upon our miseries and
anguish, upon our struggles and our weaknesses; that your countenance
may smile upon our joys and our victories. We call upon you as our
mother, like St John before us, and take you as the guide, strength and
consolation of our mortal life.

We are inspired by the certainty that your eyes are turned toward this
world, racked by wars and persecutions, and the oppression of the just
and the weak. From the shadows of this vale of tears, we seek in your
heavenly assistance, tender mercy, comfort for our aching hearts, and
help in the trials of Church and country.

We believe that in the glory where you reign, clothed with the sun and
crowned with stars, you are a source of joy and gladness for all the
angels and the saints. On this earth, where we walk as pilgrims, we are
comforted by our faith. We look to you who we honour as our life, our
sweetness and our hope, to draw us onward with the sweetness of your
voice, so that one day, after our exile, you may show us Jesus, the
blessed fruit of your womb. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
Amen.

**MORNING PRAYER:** *Lord, come to my aid. Lord, make haste to help me.*

*Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it
was in the beginning, is now, and ever will be. Amen. Alleluia.\
*

*And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and
the moon beneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. The
holy Mother of God is exalted in glory, above the choirs of angels in
the kingdom of heaven.*

*Holy Mary, of all women, you are the chosen one, who ancient prophets
promised would bear God's only Son. All generations prepared the way to
thee, that in your womb the God-man might come to set us free. Holy
Mary, you embody all God taught to every race that you are first and
foremost in fullness of His grace. We praise the wondrous honor that you
gave birth to Him who saved us from our sin.*

*Almighty and ever-living God, who assumed the Immaculate Virgin Mary,
the Mother of your Son, body and soul into heavenly glory, grant, we
pray, that, always attentive to the things that are above, we may merit
to share in her glory. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who
lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever
and ever. Amen.\
*\
**MIDDAY PRAYER \[The Magnificat\]:** *"My soul proclaims the greatness
of the Lord; my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour for he has looked with
favour on his lowly servant. From this day all generations will call me
blessed. The Almighty has done great things for me and holy is his Name.
He has mercy on those who fear him in every generation. He has shown the
strength of his arm, and has scattered the proud in their conceit. He
has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up the
lowly. He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has
sent away empty. He has come to the help of his servant Israel for he
has remembered his promise of mercy, the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children forever."*

**EVENING PRAYER:** *Let us lift up our hearts and give thanks to the
Lord our God.*

*Mary the dawn, Christ the Perfect Day;\
Mary the gate, Christ the Heavenly Way!*

*Mary the root, Christ the Mystic Vine;\
Mary the grape, Christ the Sacred Wine!*

*Mary the wheat, Christ the Living Bread;\
Mary the stem, Christ the Rose blood-red!*

*Mary the font, Christ the Cleansing Flood;\
Mary the cup, Christ the Saving Blood!*

*Mary the temple, Christ the temple\'s Lord;\
Mary the shrine, Christ the God adored!*

*Mary the beacon, Christ the Haven\'s Rest;\
Mary the mirror, Christ the Vision Blest!*

*Mary the mother, Christ the mother\'s Son\
By all things blest while endless ages run. Amen.*

**LET US PRAY:** O God, who, looking on the lowliness of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, raised her to this grace, that your Only Begotten Son was
born of her according to the flesh and that she was crowned this day
with surpassing glory, grant through her prayers, that, saved by the
mystery of your redemption, we may merit to be exalted by you on high.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Let us praise
the Lord and give him thanks. Amen

come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful; O Mother of the Word
Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer
me. (Then, please say your daily Rosary)*
