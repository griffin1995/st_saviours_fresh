\[INTRODUCTION\] September is traditionally dedicated to Our Lady of
Sorrows, whose feast-day falls on September 15, the day after Holy Cross
Day. The seven sorrows of Mary are the Prophecy of Simeon; the Flight
into Egypt; the Loss of Jesus in the Temple; meeting Jesus carrying the
Cross; the Crucifixion; receiving the dead Body of her Son; and the
Burial of her Son and closing of the Tomb. In art, Our Lady of Sorrows
is often depicted having her heart pierced by as many as seven swords,
recalling the prophecy of Simeon, "and a sword shall pierce your own
heart...".
