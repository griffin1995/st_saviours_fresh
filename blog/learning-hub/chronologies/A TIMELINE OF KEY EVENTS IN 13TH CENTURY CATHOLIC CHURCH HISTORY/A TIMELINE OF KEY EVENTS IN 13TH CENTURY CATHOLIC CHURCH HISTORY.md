\[INTRO\] In some respects, the 13th century is thought by historians to
be the apogee of the High Middle Ages. In reality it was a mixed bag for
the ordinary man. The Crusades were in full flow, and they helped build
the sea powers of Venice and Genoa, and fuelled the early days of the
Reconquista in Spain, but the Crusades had begun to lose steam in the
Middle East. The papacy was at the height of its political and financial
influence, with figures such as Innocent III wielding considerable
religious power, often to the detriment of protestant groups, such as
the Waldensians and new cults, such as the Cathars.

\[TITLE\] **The Catholic Church In The 13^th^ Century: a timeline of key
events**

\[MAIN TEXT\] The 13th century saw a succession of influential popes,
including Innocent III, Gregory IX, and Boniface VIII. These popes
played significant roles in shaping the Church and its relationship with
secular powers during a period of change and conflict. Pope Gregory IX
founded the Papal Inquisition, while Boniface VIII was best known for
his battle for supremacy with King Philip IV of France, a battle which
he lost and which ultimately led to a decline in papal power by the end
of the century. These popes, along with others of the era, navigated a
complex landscape of political, religious, and intellectual challenges,
which they did not always rise to, leaving a lasting impact on the
Catholic Church and its relationship with the wider world. 

Monasticism, the rise of university cities across Europe and axial
relationships with religious and educational institutions in Persia,
Spain and Egypt, resulted in a fruitful flow of advancements in
mathematics, logic, philosophy and theology. In Europe, at this time,
Cambridge and Bologna in particular began to come to prominence. In
particular, with the publication of treatise by theologians such as
Peter Lombard, the scholastic critical model became a touchstone of
intellectual argument and ideas. His ideas, as scholasticism began to
dominate critical theological ideas, influenced Church doctors, such as
Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Albertus Magnus. These theologians
added to the heft that the Catholic Church wielded on history in the
13th century.

Scholasticism is a method of theological inquiry that emphasises logical
reasoning and the use of dialectic to resolve theological questions. The
method led to the development of organised and comprehensive theological
systems, often beginning with arguments for the existence of
God. Moreover, the rediscovery and assimilation of Aristotle\'s works,
particularly by Aquinas, led to a more rational and philosophical
approach to theology. Even so, the century didn't swallow Aristotelian
thought wholesale. The influence of Averroes, Sigurt of Brabant and the
publication of the Condemnation of 1277 by the Bishop of Paris, and the
Condemnation of Paris in 1277, led to new lines of theological,
philosophical and scientific enquiries. Alongside scholasticism,
mystical theology also flourished, with figures like Bonaventure
exploring the experiential aspects of faith. 

Meanwhile, the early 13^th^ century in England witnessed the first
serious revolt of the elite against the irascible and unpredictable
monarchy of John Lackland, which culminated in the signing of the Magna
Carta and the foundations of the extraordinarily long road to modern-day
democracy and advancements in legal systems and economics.

It was a century in which civilisations clashed: Christians v Muslims;
Mongols v just about everyone in Eurasia. The rise and cruel expansion
of the Mongol Empire, led by Genghis Khan and his sons, which, at its
peak, would almost touch the gates of Vienna. The Mongol conquests
significantly impacted the Muslim world, including the sack of Baghdad
in 1258, which led to the decline of the Islamic Golden Age. For every
action there is a opposite reaction and it applies to politics as much
as science As the Abbasid empire was broken by the Khans, the Mamluk
dynasty was established in Egypt. It marked a shift in power in the
Middle East and also fuelled harassment of remnant Christian communities
in the eastern Mediterranean.

With such a conflict ridden and dynamic century, no wonder that economic
growth began to slow down as government resources were often redirected
to fund defence. The century ended with the onset of the Great Famine.

**....................**

**1200**: Albertus Magnus (1200-1280) is born. He would become, in turn,
a Dominican friar, the teacher of Thomas Aquinas, and a prolific writer
on various subjects, including theology and natural science. 

**1202-1204**: The catastrophic Fourth Crusade gets underway. It was
supposed to recapture Jerusalem, what it did was fatally weaken the
Byzantine Empire, as the crusading army sacked Constantinople and stayed
there. Initially targeted at capturing Jerusalem, the Fourth Crusade
resulted in the sack of Constantinople, significantly weakening the
Byzantine Empire. There were many reasons for the attack. By the time
the Crusaders got to Constantinople they had run out of money. Heavily
reliant on Venice for transportation across the Mediterranean, the
Venetians charged increasingly expensive carriage rates. Partners in the
fourth crusade, the Venetians actively encouraged the Crusaders to
attack the city in the hope of expanding their dominance of
Mediterranean trade and at the same time increase their profits from the
ill-advised venture. The administration of Constantinople was, albeit
indirectly, also complicit in the city's sacking. The Byzantine prince,
Alexios IV Angelus (son of the Emperor  calling upon the Fourth
Crusade to help him gain power. Hungry for money, the Crusaders agreed,
but then Alexios refused to pay for the favour. There were other reasons
too: since the split between the eastern and western churches in 1054,
over time religious and political differences regularly turned into
antagonism. The sack of the city helped fire and deepen these divisions.

**1205:** The Doge of Venice, Enrico Dandolo dies in Constantinople.
Although blind, Dandolo, was a prominent leader of the fourth crusade
and encouraged the sack of Constantinople, partly to eliminate it as a
commercial rival of the city state of Venice. Interestingly, if you
visit Hagia Sofia, you can still see the headstone of the tomb of
Dandolo in one of the doorway of the mosque. His body was removed and
likely destroyed when Mehmet the Conqueror took over the city in 1453.

**1206:** Genghis Khan unites the Mongol tribes and establishes the
Mongol Empire. Under leaders, such as Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan (Genghis
Khan's grandson), and others, the Mongols expanded across Asia and into
Eastern Europe, creating one of the largest contiguous land empires in
history. 

**1215:** The First Baron's war in England breaks out. This first
outbreak lasted about two years. The barons, led by Robert Fitzwalter,
rebelled against the despotic and incompetent rule of King John I, the
last of the sons of Henry II. The rule of King John I is often compared,
negatively, to that of his father, Henry II, who established Angevin
rule across England and much of France. King John had waged a series of
conflicts against the French king, Philip II of France, gradually losing
much of his family's land to the French monarch. John quickly acquired
the nickname Lackland, in acknowledgement of his lack of military
prowess. The King had also begun to row back from the agreement, known
as Magna Carta, signed on June 15^th^ that year.

**1215:** The Magna Carta was signed. A beautifully written copy of the
Magna Carta can be seen in a glass case at Salisbury Cathedral. The
tightly written charter is a document that outlines the protection of
church rights and the protection of the barons from illegal
imprisonment. Magna Carta held clauses that theoretically noticeably
reduced the authority of the King, such as Clause 61, called the
'security clause', which allowed the barons to override the King at any
time by means of force, a medieval legal process known as *distraint*.
The charter also put limits on the feudal payments that landowners
(essentially the barons) owed each year to the crown; and a confirmation
of rights outlined in the Charter of Liberties. The Charter of
Liberties, signed in 1100 by Henry I. The document addressed abuses of
royal power by his predecessor William II (who was in fact, Henry's
brother, William Rufus). It specifically forbade the over-taxation of
the barons, the abuse of vacant parishes or sees, and the practices
of simony (the sale of ecclesiastical privileges) and pluralism (the
holding of more than one ecclesiastic position). As the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Stephen Langton, who drafted Magna Carta, both charters
covered almost identical rights. That might have been the case, but in
the event, neither side kept to its terms. In the event, the charter was
annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Baron's War (*see
entry above*). John died soon after, but after his death, the regency
administration of his son (Henry III), reissued Magna Carta stripped of
much of its content. Many years later, short of funds, Henry III
reissued Magna Carta again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes.
His son, Edward I, reissued the charter for the last time, in 1297, this
time confirming it as part of English law. Now the charter is part of
English heritage; but it set the stage for the eventual creation of an
English parliament, which set the country on a long, tortuous road to
democracy.

**1215:** The Fourth Lateran Council, convened by Pope Innocent III,
defined key doctrines. The council addressed a number of issues,
including the sacraments, the role of the laity, the treatment of Jews
and heretics, and the organisation of the church. The teachings of the
Cathars and Waldensians were condemned, resulting in their hounding and
persecution by the Church. Innocent also ordered a four-year truce among
Christian rulers so that a new Crusade could be launched. The Orthodox
churches do not accept any of the five Lateran councils as truly
ecumenical. The decree mandating annual confession and the promotion of
the doctrine of transubstantiation, raised the profile of the council in
Catholic history. Transubstantiation is of particular import, as it
raised to the status of miracle, the moment in the alteration of
substance by which the bread and wine become in reality the body and
blood of Jesus Christ. The council was years in preparation. Over 1200
abbots, priors and bishops attended, as did the representatives of
Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor of the west. It was the most
important council to have taken place, up to the calling of the Council
of Trent in 1563, in response to the Reformation and the rise of
Protestantism across Europe.

**1216:** Innocent III (1198-1216) dies:

**1216:** Lothario of Segni, known to us as Pope Innocent III
(1198-1216) dies**.** Considered one of the most powerful Popes of the
Middle Ages, Innocent III asserted papal authority over secular rulers
and played a key role in the Fourth Crusade. Innocent greatly extended
the scope of the Crusades, directing crusades against Muslim Iberia and
the Holy Land as well as the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in
southern France. He personally organised the Fourth Crusade of
1202--1204, which ended in the sack of Constantinople. Innocent III
famously annulled the Magna Carta, likely because he believed that the
revolt of the barons in England, violated not only the feudal rights of
King John I, but also his own. England had been ceded as a papal fief by
the King two years earlier, who was coming under pressure from his
disaffected barons, and whose lands were steadily encroached upon by the
French crown, taking advantage of his incompetence and weakness as a
military leader. He agreed to become a vasal of the pope, which included
an annual tribute of 1000 marks. The English barons were horrified by
this development, but the agreement remained in place until 1365 when
the English parliament declared the agreement invalid. Pope Innocent's
commitment to reform resulted in the famous Fourth Lateran Council,
which established important doctrines (transubstantiation among them)
and a clampdown on simony. However, its pursuit of heretics and Jews
rightly attracted criticism and controversy.

**1216:** The Order of Preachers was founded. We know it today as the
Dominican Order, founded by the Spanish priest Dominic de Guzman
(1170-1221), in France. The order was quickly approved by Pope Honorius
II (1216-1227), shortly before he died. The order was founded to combat
heresy and to promote the study of theology. Several notable theologians
have been Dominicans, including St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Albert the
Great, sometimes called Simon Magnus (1200 to 1260), and St. Catherine
of Siena (1347-1380. Other prominent figures include Cardinal Cajetan,
John of St. Thomas, and more contemporary theologians such as the French
priest Yves Congar (1904-1995) and the Peruvian liberation theologist
Gustavo Gutiérrez (1928-1924). 

**1221:** Giovanni di Fidanza (1221--1274), known to history as
Bonaventure, is born. He would become a Franciscan bishop, Minister
General of the Franciscans, known as the Order of the Friars Minor and a
cardinal. He is best known as a theologian and philosopher. also
renowned for his influential writings, including *The Journey of the
Mind into God,* and for his role in shaping Franciscan theology and
spirituality. He was canonised by Pope Sixtus V, in 1588 and his feast
day is July 15th.

**1220:** On the feast of Pentecost in 1220 the first general chapter of
the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) was held at Bologna, and a system of
democratic government of the monks, who were devoted to poverty and
teaching. At the second general chapter, held on Pentecost in 1221, also
at Bologna, the order was divided geographically into provinces. After a
visit to Venice in 1221, Dominic died at Bologna. A great friend of St
Francis, he was deeply influenced by the piety, simplicity and
achievements of the Franciscan order, which he sought to replicate,
although the order was characterised by a passionate devotion of the
faith against the so-called heresies of the Cathars and Waldensians, who
the Dominicans helped to suppress, rarely in a kind or sympathetic way.
The rise of so many Dominican theologians at the height of the Medieval
period however, helped soften the image of the order.

**1221:** St Dominic dies on August 6th 1221, in Bologna, Italy, and was
canonised on July 3rd, **1223:** The Franciscan Order, founded by Saint
Francis of Assisi, received formal papal approval. 

**1225:** Thomas Aquinas (1225--1274) was born. He would grow up to
become one of the most famous doctors of the Church and influencer in
the Medieval period. His stature as an intellectual helped to soften the
image of the Dominicans, who would be regularly associated with the
callous suppression of heretics in the 13th and 14th centuries. He
became celebrated for his theology and philosophical works. He took the
scholastic method to a new level and took his inspirations from leading
philosophers of ancient Greece. He is regularly invoked by leading
Catholic influencers even in the 21st century, by luminaries such as
Pope Benedict XIII and Bishop Baron.

**1226:** Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone (c.1181 --1226), better known
as Francis of Assisi, dies. Canonised in 1228 by Pope Gregory IX, he is
one of the most beloved of saints and alongside St Catherine of Siena is
the patron saint of Italy. Commonly portrayed wearing a brown habit with
a rope tied around his waist, by the 13^th^ century Italian painter
Giotto, the rope is regularly featured as consisting of three knots
which represent poverty, chastity, and obedience. His sanctity was
defined in his lifetime by the stigmata.

**1227:** Honorius III (1216-1227) dies. Best known for approving the
founding of the Franciscan and Dominican order, Pope Honorius III
continued the reforms instigated by Pope Innocent II. He also supported
the build-up by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II's efforts to recover
the Holy Land from Muslim control, sometimes known as the Fifth Crusade,
specifically Emperor Frederick II\'s crusade, which was launched in
1228, some months after the death of Honorius III. He also was a strong
supporter of the 20 year long crusade against the Albigensians in
southern France. for his strong support of the Crusades. 

**1227:** Gregory IX (1227-1241) succeeds Honorius III as pope. Pope
Gregory IX is known for two important developments. First, he ordered
the first complete collection of papal decretals, called the Corpus
Iuris Canonici, a code of Catholic canon law, which remained a
foundation of ecclesiastic law until 1918. Decretals are canonical
epistles, written by the pope either alone, or with cardinals, that
determine and answer a controversy within the Church's teaching or
administration. His second major act was to establish the so called
Papal Inquisition; a series of institutional measures established to
combat heresy and enforce religious conformity dating from 1233. There
had been other papal enquiries, called inquisitions, but this took the
term to a new level. It was centralised, it appointed special
inquisitors, selected from religious orders, such as the Dominicans, who
were empowered to investigate and prosecute heretics, and under certain
conditions apply torture. In 20^th^ century eyes, it was not one of the
Church's finest moments.

**1250:** The Mamluk Sultanate is founded in Egypt. 

**1253:** Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175-1253), the English statesman,
theologian, and scientist, known for his work on optics and his
influence on the development of English theology dies.

**1258:** The Mongol conquest of Baghdad, effectively ending the Abbasid
Caliphate. 

**1259:** Treaty of Paris is signed between Louis IX of France and Henry
III of England. 

**1265:** Simon de Montfort convenes the first English Parliament. 

**1271-1295:** Marco Polo travels to China, documenting his
experiences. 

**1274:** The Second Council of Lyons, aiming to reconcile the Eastern
and Western churches, but ultimately unsuccessful. 

**1277:** The Condemnation of 1277. With so many theological lines of
enquiry influenced by Aristotle in the 12^th^ century, it was inevitable
that at some point, there would be blowback. In 1277, the Bishop of
Paris, Étienne Tempier, issued a treatise, attacking some 219
propositions stemming from Aristotelian thought that was influencing
theological debate at the University of Paris. Aristotle's treatises,
such as Physics, and On the Soul, were by 1277 translated into Latin and
included in the study curriculum at the university. Some interpretations
of Aristotle's teaching, particularly on natural causes and determinism,
clashed with Christian teachings on free will, divine creation, and the
possibility of miracles.  The condemnation was not a blanket ban on
Aristotle\'s works, but rather a targeted response to specific
interpretations and their perceived implications. It also asserted God's
absolute power over creation, the operation of free will over
environmental determinism, and the immortality of the soul (*please see
the entries for Siger of Brabant and Averroes*). The condemnation marked
a turning point in scholastic philosophy, encouraging a move away from
strict adherence to Aristotelian principles and a greater emphasis on
divine omnipotence and contingency. It led to a re-evaluation of
Aristotelian philosophy and its compatibility with Christian
doctrine. Many centuries later, science scholars such as Pierre Duhem
(1861-1916), a leader in the study of thermodynamics, argued that the
condemnation of 1277 marked a turning point in the development of modern
science by encouraging a more critical approach to Aristotle. 

**1284:** Siger of Brabant (c. 1240--1284) dies. A controversial figure
associated with the 'Radical Aristotelianism' movement, who challenged
some traditional theological doctrines. Radical Aristotelianism, often
associated with Averroism (*see the entry for Averroes in the 12^th^
century timeline*), was a philosophical movement in the 13th and 14th
centuries that emphasised the use of reason and Aristotle\'s philosophy,
sometimes leading to conclusions that conflicted with Christian
doctrine. Key points of contention included the nature of the soul, the
possibility of earthly happiness, and the eternity of the world. Some
conclusions derived from Aristotelian philosophy clashed with core
Christian beliefs. Aristotle's proposition of a single, universal
intellect (which has ties with Indian Brahmin mystical beliefs), were
regarded as contradicting the Catholic belief in the immortality of the
individual human soul. The movement is also associated with the theory
of 'double truth'. This concept suggests there can be conflicting truths
that result from philosophy and religious dogma, reflecting the tension
between them. In today's world, this is superseded by the addition of
scientific truths, creating even more intellectual tension. Despite
these considerations, it had a lasting impact on Medieval and
Renaissance thought; and there is an argument that its emphasis on
reason and natural philosophy, led to the Enlightenment and modern,
rigorous, scientific enquiry and the rise of the natural sciences.

**1285:** William of Ockham (1285--1347) is born. Although William is
best known largely for his contributions to logic and philosophy, he
also had a significant impact on theological thought in the late Middle
Ages. 

**1291:** The last Crusader stronghold in the Holy Land falls, marking
the end of the Crusades.
