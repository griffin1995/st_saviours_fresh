**\[TITLE\] The Litany Of Our Lady Of Mount Carmel**

\[MAIN TEXT\] The Litany emphasises the virtues of Our Lady, such as her obedience, purity, and devotion, presenting her as a model for all Christians to emulate and acknowledges her role in bringing Christ into the world. It underscores her intercession for humanity, particularly for sinners and those in need. The Litany invokes her as a refuge in sorrow, a guide in darkness, and a source of hope and consolation, particularly at the hour of death. 

The litany, especially when linked with the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, underscores the Carmelite Order\'s devotion to Mary and her special protection over those who wear the scapular, under certain conditions.
