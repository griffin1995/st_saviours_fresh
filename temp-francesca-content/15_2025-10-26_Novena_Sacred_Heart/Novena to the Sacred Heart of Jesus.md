\[intro\] The Sacred Heart Novena is most traditionally prayed during the nine days leading up to the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which is always 19 days after Pentecost on a Friday. While this novena leads up to the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, it also prepares our hearts for the Memorial of the Immaculate Heart of Mary the day after.

\[MAIN TEXT\]

**SHORT FORM NOVENA:** O most holy heart of Jesus, fountain of every blessing, I adore you, I love you, and with lively sorrow for my sins, I offer you this poor heart of mine. Make me humble, patient, pure and wholly obedient to your will. Grant, good Jesus, that I may live in you and for you. O my Jesus, you have said: "Truly I say to you, ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you." Protect me in the midst of danger. Comfort me in my afflictions. Give me health of body, assistance in my temporal needs, your blessing on all that I do, and the grace of a holy death. Amen.

*This is followed by: The Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Glory be to the Father.*

Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all my trust in you. O my Jesus, you have said: "Truly I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you."  Behold, in your name, I ask the Father for the grace of my request. 

*This is followed by: The Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Glory be to the Father.*

Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all my trust in you.\
O my Jesus, you have said: "Truly I say to you, heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away."

*This is followed by: The Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Glory be to the Father.*

Sacred Heart of Jesus, for whom it is impossible not to have compassion on the afflicted, have pity on us miserable sinners and grant us the grace which we ask of you, through the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary, your tender Mother and ours. 

**SALVE REGINA:** Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, Hail our life, our sweetness and our hope. To you do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To you do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. May we be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
