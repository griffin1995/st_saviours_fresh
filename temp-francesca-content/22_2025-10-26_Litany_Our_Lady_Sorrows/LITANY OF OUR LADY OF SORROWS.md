\[INTRODUCTION\] September is traditionally dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, whose feast-day falls on September 15, the day after Holy Cross Day. The seven sorrows of Mary are the Prophecy of Simeon; the Flight into Egypt; the Loss of Jesus in the Temple; meeting Jesus carrying the Cross; the Crucifixion; receiving the dead Body of her Son; and the Burial of her Son and closing of the Tomb. In art, Our Lady of Sorrows is often depicted having her heart pierced by as many as seven swords, recalling the prophecy of Simeon, "and a sword shall pierce your own heart...".
