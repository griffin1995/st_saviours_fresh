\[INTRO\] In January 2025, some significant Catholic feast days include the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God on January 1st, the Epiphany of the Lord on January 5th, and the Baptism of the Lord on January 12th. The Feast of the Holy Family is celebrated on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year\'s Day, which in 2025 falls on December 29th, 2024. 

**\[TITLE\] Spiritual Thought For The Month Of January**

The last verse of the beautiful hymn, *Like the dawning of the morning*, contains the lines: Thou hast waited, Child of David! And thy waiting now is o\'er! Thou hast seen Him Blessed Mother! And wilt see him evermore! Oh! His Human Face and Features, They were passing sweet to see; Thou beholdest them this moment; Mother, show them now to me! These lines hold high the promise of the Christmas Season and the hope of a new and better tomorrow, based on our faith in the Christ and his message of salvation, which gives us hope we will, one day, see Him in all his glory in Heaven. What an illuminating and lifting message.

The Hymn underscores the meaning of family: first, the glory of the Holy Family, the key protagonists of this Church season. To underscore this point, on January 1^st^ we honour Our Lady, the mother of the Christ, followed by the celebration of the Holy Family on January 2^nd^. These feasts mirror the substance of our own family relationships, as well as the importance of our extended family, the Church.

It is easy to fall in line with the accepted terms that the Holy Family is a perfect template for our own family life; based on faith, love and self-sacrifice in the interests of the whole. And we might consider that in comparing our own, sometimes tortured, stressful and/or estranged family relationships that we fail by comparison.

It is true that the Holy Family is a perfect entity, and we honour Our Lady and St Joseph as exemplars. Nonetheless, their family life was not easy by any means. Our image of them as perfect vessels is almost tragically, ironic, given how complicated their lives were. Although Our Lady's pregnancy was part of God's plan, it must have felt deeply unplanned in the context of Mary and Joseph's relationship; and her relationship with her parents and extended family.  The Gospel of St Matthew's homes in on the depth of faith Joseph had in God, which committed him to Our Lady, even after discovering his betrothed pregnant. St Luke meanwhile focuses on Our Lady welcoming the words of the angel Gabriel, in the Magnificat, despite the weighty consequences of her accepting God's wishes.

From that point, the lives of Our Lady and St Joseph didn't get any easier: they found no welcome in Bethlehem, and were reduced to spending days in a stable, housing cattle. And soon after, had to flee as refugees to Egypt to escape persecution, and likely death, by Herod's soldiers. Then the practicalities of a refugee life took over as both had to rebuild their lives from scratch in a new country and make it a loving and viable home for the child Jesus.

It's a tableau that, sadly, can readily be recognised today, in conflict zones, such as Palestine (how ironic), in Ukraine, in Yemen, in Syria, and even, in these days of austerity, on the streets of the UK, Argentina and anywhere where economic policy leaves many stranded, homeless and fearful.

Given these considerations, it is the overcoming of suffering and strife, while still maintaining their commitment to God and to each other, that is the true message of the Holy Family. It is one that many of us in the Catholic Church can identify with, as we walk our own, sometimes difficult pilgrim journey.  At the core though, the Holy Family symbolises hope: in God, for his plan for them, and in our faith in God's plan for each of us.

May God bless you with a happy and fulfilling year ahead for you, and your families; the dawning of many happy mornings for you all.
