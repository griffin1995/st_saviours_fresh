\[INTRODUCTION\] The late Pope Benedict XVI, fortified the devotion to the Sacred Heart in his book Behold the Pierced One, claiming that in the devotion to the Sacred Heart, the "centre of Christianity is laid before us".

**\[TITLE\] Devotions to the Sacred Heart**

\[MAINT TEXT\] The image of the Sacred Heart, of the Incarnate Jesus pointing to his pierced, bleeding, thorn-encircled, and enflamed heart, presents the heart and face of Christ. To reflect upon these together, Pope Benedict wrote, is transformative, since "anyone who gazes upon the face of the Lord, which the servants of the Sanhedrin and Pilate's servants have spat upon, which they have slapped and covered with spittle, will see in his face the mirror of our violence, a reflection of what sin is, and their conscience will be purified in the way that is the precondition . . . for every improvement in human affairs."

Meditating on Jesus's often scorned and wounded heart, shows us the ugliness of sin. In adoring it, we move towards purifying our own heart and conscience, freeing us to develop a closer relationship with the Divinity of Christ, our Saviour. The image of the Sacred Heart is an open invitation to participate in Christ's deep and abiding love, which led to his sacrifice on Calvary, that we might be redeemed. What greater love is there?

**Devotion to the Sacred Heart and Jesus's promise to celebrants**

The Friday that follows the Second Sunday after Pentecost is the Feast of the Sacred Heart. Many Catholics prepare for this Feast by beginning a Novena to the Sacred Heart on the Feast of Corpus Christi, which is celebrated from the Thursday of the week before. On the Feast of the Sacred Heart itself, we can gain a plenary indulgence by making an Act of Reparation to the Sacred Heart.

Devotions to the Sacred Heart were common in Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries. However, the popularisation of this devotion took root after St. Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647-1690), a Visitation nun, enjoyed a personal revelation of the Christ, involving a series of visions as she prayed before the Blessed Sacrament. She wrote, "He disclosed to me the marvels of his Love and the inexplicable secrets of his Sacred Heart." Christ talked to her of His love for mankind and the pain caused by the indifference of people to this love. He promised that, in response to those who consecrate themselves and make reparations to His Sacred Heart. He promised to:

-   give them all the graces necessary in their state of life.

-   establish peace in their homes.

-   comfort them in all their afflictions.

-   be their secure refuge during life, and above all, in death.

-   bestow abundant blessings upon all their undertakings.

-   show sinners that his Heart is the source of an infinite ocean of mercy.

-   bless every place in which an image of His Heart is exposed and honoured.

-   give to priests the gift of touching the most hardened hearts.

Those who promote this devotion will have their names written in His Heart. Lukewarm souls will become fervent and fervent souls will quickly mount to high perfection. Moreover, Jesus promised that the grace of final perseverance will be given to all those who receive Holy Communion on the First Fridays for nine consecutive months. Celebrants will not die in His disgrace, or without receiving the sacraments. His divine Heart will be their refuge at this time. Devotions attached to these promises include:

-   Receiving Communion frequently

-   Going to Confession

-   Receiving the Eucharist on the first Friday of each month for nine consecutive months.

-   Undertaking Eucharistic Adoration for one hour on Thursdays. This Holy Hour can be made alone or as part of a group with formal prayers.

-   Celebrating the Feast of the Sacred Heart

**The Prayer of Reparation to the Sacred Heart**

Most sweet Jesus, whose overflowing charity for men is requited by so much forgetfulness, negligence and contempt, behold us prostrate before You, eager to repair by a special act of homage the cruel indifference and injuries to which Your loving Heart is subject.

Mindful that we ourselves have had a share in such indignities, which we now deplore, we humbly ask Your pardon and declare our readiness to atone. We do this not only for our own personal offences, but also for the offences of others who, straying from the path of salvation, obstinately refuse to follow You, their Shepherd; or who have renounced the promises of their baptism and cast off the sweet yoke of Your law.

We resolve to expiate the outrages committed against You, determined to make amends for the manifold offences that offend Your Sacred Heart, including immodesty, corruption, the violations of Sundays and holy days, and the sins of blasphemy. We also strive to make amends for the insults to which the Pope and the clergy are subjected to; for acts of sacrilege against the Church, its teaching and in particular, against the Blessed Sacrament. We also ask for forgiveness and make amends by prayers, for the crimes of nations who resist the rights and teaching authority of the Church.

We now join in prayerful reparations for any and all violations against Your Divinity and the immense sacrifice you undertook on Calvary, which we honour in the Mass. We offer these reparations in union with the acts of atonement of Your Blessed Mother, those of the Saints and the pious faithful. We promise to continue with these reparations, with the help of Your grace, for all the sins we and others have committed in the past. We promise to live a life of unswerving faith, of purity of conduct, of perfect observance of the precepts of the Gospel and especially of charity. We promise to do this to the best of our power and to try to deter others from offending You, and to try to bring as many as possible to follow You and the precepts of Your Church.

O loving Jesus, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mother, our model in reparation, deign to receive the voluntary offering we make of these reparations. We ask for the crowning gift of perseverance, to keep us faithful in our duty and the allegiance we owe You, so that we may all one day come to rest in that happy home, where with the Father and the Holy Spirit You also live and reign, Amen.

**Enthronement of the Sacred Heart in our homes**

This recognition is manifest by giving the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus a place of honor in the home which is solemnly offered to Him by an act of consecration. A blessed image of the Sacred Heart is hung in a prominent place in the home, and Sacred Scripture is placed before it. Formal prayers follow, including:

*O Lord Jesus Christ, To your most Sacred Heart, I confide this intention: (mention your intention). Only look upon me, And then do What your Sacred Heart inspires. Let your Sacred Heart decide. I count on it. I trust in it I throw myself on Your mercy, Lord Jesus! You will not fail me. Amen.*

**V.** The Word was made Flesh and dwelt amongst us.\
**R.** Eternal Word, made man for love of us, we adore You with mind and heart, and with the most profound veneration. To make amends for\
our ingratitude for so great a benefit, we unite in sincerity of heart with all those who love You, and offer You, our most humble and affectionate thanksgivings. Deeply conscious of that excess of humility, goodness, and sweetness, which we acknowledge in the Divine Heart,\
we petition You for Thy grace to imitate these virtues, so pleasing to You.\
\
*This is followed by: The Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Glory be to the Father.\
*\
**V.** He was crucified also for us. He suffered under Pontius Pilate and was buried.\
**R.** Jesus, our admirable Redeemer, we adore You with our mind and heart, and with the most profound veneration. We grieve for our past insensibility to the outrages and sufferings which Your most loving Heart has endured for our redemption through Your bitter Passion. We unite in sincerity of heart with all those who love You, to thank you wholeheartedly. We admire the infinite patience and generosity of Your\
Divine Heart, and petition You to replenish our hearts with courage to\
embrace our sufferings and fix our great consolation in Your cross.\
\
*This is followed by: The Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Glory be to the Father.\
*\
**V.** Thou hast given them bread from heaven, which abounds with all delights.\
**R.** O Jesus, burning with love for us, we adore You with our mind and heart, and with the most profound veneration. We unite with sincere hearts with all those who love you, render you thanks and atonement for the outrages which Your Divine Heart suffers in the Most Blessed Sacrament. We revere you and the love you showed Your Eternal Father, humbly asking you to inflame our hearts with love of God and of our neighbour.\
\
This is followed by: The Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Glory be to the Father.

**Singular devotional prayers to the Sacred Heart**

**ACT OF ADORATION:**

O Most Holy Heart of my dearly beloved Jesus, I desire to renew and to offer You these acts of adoration, and these prayers at every possible moment. I offer them for myself, my family, friends and neighbours. I recommend to You the holy Catholic Church, its parishioners and the souls undergoing your justice, poor sinners, the sick and afflicted, the agonised and all the people of the world.

Although we do not deserve your mercy, we humbly ask not to permit Your suffering for the redemption of humanity to become useless to sinners and those who may not accept your teaching and sacrifice. I ask too for the relief of all souls in Purgatory, particularly to those souls who in life were pious and devoted to your service.

O Divine Heart of Jesus, I adore You with all my heart and soul and consecrate them to you for all time. I devote my thoughts, words and actions to your glory. I ask you to give me strength to face all challenges, to have steadfast faith in your mercy and infinite merits, and to protect me and my family, and when my time on earth is over, to be my refuge when I die. Vouchsafe, through Thine infinite goodness, to receive and hear my petitions and humble devotions.

**PRAYER OF ADORATION:**

O most holy heart of Jesus, fountain of every blessing, I adore you, I love you, and with lively sorrow for my sins, I offer you this poor heart of mine. Make me humble, patient, pure and obedient to your will. Grant, good Jesus, that I live in you and for you.

**DAILY PRAYER TO THE SACRED HEART:**

O most holy heart of Jesus, fountain of every blessing, I adore You, I love You, and with lively sorrow for my sins I offer You this poor heart of mine. Make me humble, patient, pure and wholly obedient to Your will. Grant, good Jesus, that I may live in You and for You. Protect me in the midst of danger. Comfort me in my afflictions. Give me health of body, assistance in my temporal needs, Your blessing on all that I do, and the grace of a holy death. Amen. 

**PRAYER FOR THE CHURCH:**

Most sacred Heart of Jesus, pour down Your blessings abundantly on Your holy Church, on the Supreme Pontiff, and on all the clergy. Grant perseverance to the just, convert sinners, enlighten infidels, bless our parents, friends, and benefactors, assist the dying, free the souls in purgatory, and extend over all hearts the sweet empire of Your love. 

**PRAYER TO THE SACRED HEART IN DIFFICULT TIMES:**

Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all my trust in you. In this time of difficulty and uncertainty, I turn to you for comfort and strength. Your love is a beacon of hope, and I know that even in my darkest moments, you are with me. 

Grant me the grace to trust in your divine will, even when I do not understand. Help me to see the beauty and purpose in my struggles. Give me the courage to face my fears and the wisdom to make the right decisions. 

Sacred Heart of Jesus, you are my refuge and my protector. Be with me in my trials, and lead me to peace and healing. I ask for your merciful intercession, and I place my entire being in your loving embrace. 

**ST GERTRUDE'S PRAYER TO THE SACRED HEART:**

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, fountain of eternal life, Your Heart is a glowing furnace of Love. You are my refuge and my sanctuary.

O my adorable and loving Saviour, consume my heart with the burning fire with which Yours is inflamed. Pour down on my soul those graces which flow from Your love. Let my heart be united with Yours. Let my will be conformed to Yours in all things. May Your Will be the rule of all my desires and actions. Amen.

**ST MARGARET MARY ALACOQUE'S PRAYER TO THE SACRED HEART:**

Lord Jesus, let my heart never rest until it finds You, who are its centre, its love, and its happiness. By the wound in Your heart, pardon the sins that I have committed whether out of malice or out of evil desires. Place my weak heart in your own divine heart, continually under your protection and guidance, so that I may persevere in doing good and in fleeing evil until my last breath. Amen.

**BLESSED MIGUEL PRO'S PRAYER TO THE SACRED HEART:**

Heart of Jesus, I give my heart to Thee. Enclose it in Thee that it may never be separated from Thee. Heart of Jesus, I am all Thine; but take care of my promise so that I may be able to put it in practice even unto the complete sacrifice of my life. Amen.

**MEMORARE TO THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS:**

Remember, O most kind Jesus, that none who have had recourse to Your Sacred Heart, implored its assistance, or called for mercy, have ever been abandoned. Filled and animated by this same confidence, O divine Heart, Ruler of all hearts, I fly to You, and oppressed beneath the weight of my sins, I prostrate myself before You. Despise not Your unworthy child, but grant me, I pray, an entrance into Your Sacred Heart. Sustain me in all my combats and be with me now, and at all times, but especially in the hour of my death. O gracious Jesus! O amiable Jesus! O loving Jesus! Amen.
